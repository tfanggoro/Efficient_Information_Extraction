    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "🚀 **Jenis-Jenis Generative AI dan Aplikasinya**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Generative Text Model**\n",
    "Model bahasa seperti GPT-4 dapat digunakan untuk menulis artikel, cerita, skrip, atau bahkan kode pemrograman.\n",

    "### Prompt pada Language Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Untuk menghasilkan output yang sesuai, **LLM** memerlukan **Prompt**. **Prompt** dapat dianalogikan sebagai sebuah petunjuk untuk **LLM**. Secara eksplisit, **Prompt** merujuk kepada instruksi atau detail yang diberikan kepada LLM terkait output seperti apa yang diharapkan. **Prompt** juga bisa berupa konteks atau latar belakang dari topik yang ingin diketahui.\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 Beberapa tips awal untuk merancang sebuah prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Buat Prompt yang Sederhana**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Pembuatan prompt merupakan proses iteratif. Selalu mulai dengan sebuah prompt sederhana. Jika masih belum mendapatkan output yang diinginkan dari LLM, kita bisa me-refine prompt yang sudah dibuat sebelumnya.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hindari pembuatan prompt untuk task yang kompleks. Kita dapat mem-break down task yang kompleks tersebut menjadi subtask yang lebih kecil dan membuat prompt yang berbeda untuk masing-masing subtask.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Berikan Perintah yang Jelas: What to Do and What Not to Do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Saat membuat sebuah prompt, pastikan prompt memiliki instruksi yang jelas. Misalnya, kita menginginkan ringkasan dari sebuah kalimat, maka prompt yang efektif mengandung instruksi untuk membuat ringkasan tersebut. Kita juga dapat mendefinisikan detail apa yang tidak perlu dimasukkan dalam ringkasan yang dihasilkan LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Be Speficic and Detail**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Selain memberikan perintah yang jelas, kita dapat membuat prompt menjadi lebih spesifik dan detail. Misalnya, kita dapat mendefinisikan detail seperti gaya bahasa dan panjang output yang diharapkan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contoh prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarize the following article into approximately 150 words, highlighting the main points and key information discussed. Do not include minor details, personal opinions, or repetitive information.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "Saat ini, LLM banyak dipilih karena keandalan dan kemampuannya untuk memahami konteks yang rumit. Selain itu, LLM juga mampu untuk menghasilkan teks dan narasi yang hampir menyamai produk bahasa yang ditulis oleh manusia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Akan tetapi, perlu diperhatikan bahwa saat ini LLM masih menjadi topik riset yang aktif. Para peneliti masih mengembangkan metode yang lebih advanced untuk menghadapi tantangan serta hal-hal yang masih dipertimbangkan dalam implementasi penggunaan Generative AI, seperti:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Technical Expertise**\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative AI membutuhkan keahlian teknis yang mendalam, termasuk pemahaman tentang pembelajaran mesin, pemrosesan bahasa alami, dan arsitektur model AI seperti GANs atau LLM. Pengembangan dan penerapan model AI generatif juga memerlukan keahlian dalam pemrosesan data, pelatihan model, dan evaluasi performa. Keterbatasan dalam keahlian teknis dapat menghambat penerapan yang efektif dan optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Privacy Concern**\n",
    "\n",
    "Penggunaan dataset besar untuk melatih model AI generatif sering kali melibatkan data sensitif atau pribadi, menimbulkan masalah privasi dan keamanan. Memastikan bahwa data yang digunakan mematuhi regulasi privasi seperti GDPR atau CCPA sangat penting. Selain itu, ada risiko bahwa model dapat \"mengingat\" data sensitif dan secara tidak sengaja mengungkapkannya melalui outputnya.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Quality Control**\n",
    "\n",
    "Mengendalikan kualitas output yang dihasilkan oleh model AI generatif bisa menjadi tantangan. Model AI dapat menghasilkan konten yang tidak akurat, tidak sesuai konteks, atau tidak memenuhi standar kualitas yang diharapkan. Memerlukan mekanisme validasi dan verifikasi untuk memastikan output yang dihasilkan benar dan berguna.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dependence on Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "Kinerja model AI generatif sangat bergantung pada kualitas dan kuantitas data yang digunakan untuk melatihnya. Data yang bias atau tidak representatif dapat menghasilkan output yang juga bias atau tidak akurat. Selain itu, model memerlukan data yang sangat banyak untuk dilatih secara efektif, yang bisa menjadi kendala bagi organisasi dengan sumber daya data yang terbatas.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Ethical Implications**\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative AI dapat digunakan untuk menghasilkan konten yang menyesatkan atau merugikan, seperti deepfake, berita palsu, atau konten yang tidak pantas. Etika dalam penggunaan AI sangat penting untuk dipertimbangkan, termasuk memastikan bahwa teknologi ini digunakan secara bertanggung jawab dan tidak disalahgunakan.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Integration with Existing Systems**\n",
    "\n",
    "Mengintegrasikan generative AI dengan sistem yang sudah ada bisa menjadi kompleks dan memerlukan penyesuaian infrastruktur. Ini termasuk integrasi dengan basis data, sistem manajemen konten, dan alat analitik. Memastikan bahwa generative AI dapat bekerja secara mulus dengan sistem yang ada memerlukan perencanaan dan pengujian yang cermat.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Unclear ROI**\n",
    "\n",
    "Mengukur Return on Investment (ROI) dari proyek generative AI bisa sulit karena hasilnya sering kali bersifat kualitatif dan jangka panjang. Organisasi mungkin kesulitan untuk membuktikan nilai bisnis langsung dari investasi dalam generative AI, terutama jika manfaatnya tidak langsung terlihat.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Regulatory Changes**\n",
    "\n",
    "Regulasi terkait dengan AI dan data privasi terus berkembang. Organisasi harus selalu memantau perubahan regulasi dan memastikan bahwa penggunaan generative AI tetap sesuai dengan hukum yang berlaku. Kegagalan dalam mematuhi regulasi dapat menyebabkan denda dan kerugian reputasi."

       " Document(page_content='“In the world of business and sustainability, John Elkington’s work soars above all \\n— it is honest, practical, compassionate and deeply informed. Cannibals with Forks \\nis a brilliant synthesis of his genius for cutting through the thicket of tough issues \\nand producing elegant solutions that can be applied today.” \\nPaul Hawken, Author, The Ecology of Commerce  \\n“John Elkington forthrightly and clearly conveys that sustainability, as a new value, will be the “price of entry” that society will demand for business success in the 21st \\ncentury. I believe this is an essential message for all forward thinking businesses.”  \\nDeborah D. Anderson, Vice President, \\nEnvironmental Quality Worldwide, Proctor and Gamble  \\n“The Triple  Bottom Line is becoming an imperative. Environmental and social \\nresponsibility should beat at the heart of every business leader.” \\nAnita Roddick, CEO, Founder of the Body Shop \\n“Leading edge corporations must be moving up a gear, beyond eco-efficiency. The \\nwinners are driving up the sustainability curve and and enriching social capital. Those idling, satisfied with “Beyond Compliance”, will end up in the scrap yard. \\nThis book is the corporate citizen’s route map.” \\nPatrick Thomas, CEO, ICI Polyurethanes \\n“I commend this book. John Elkington has consistently both challenged us all to \\nthink differently and offered us a way to do so. The issue of how to define \\nsustainability in day to day terms is one which all companies should face up to. There are no ready answers, but Cannibals with Forks provides us with a good \\ncompass. And it is both constructive and stimulating to read.” \\nRodney Chose, Deputy Chief Executive, British Petroleum \\n“While not everyone would accept John Elkington’s assertion that most company \\nboards are both deaf and blind when it comes to monitoring the emerging agenda on \\nsustainable development, I suspect that almost all would benefit from a greater understanding of the issues he describes so well.” \\nSir Anthony Cleaver, Chairman, AEA Technology plc \\n“The face of corporate environmentalism has changed dramatically in the past few years. Cannibals with Forks is a testament to that shift, and shows how sustainable \\ndevelopment has become a priority for astute CEOs. Companies are increasingly \\nusing efficiency to achieve what John Elkington calls the triple bottom line: profitable operations, sound ecology and social progress.

       " Document(page_content='FOREWORD \\n \\n“Is it progress,” the Polish poet Stanislaw Lee asked, “if a cannibal uses a fork?” I believe it can be, particularly in the case of corporate capitalism and corporate \\ncannibalism. If this last phrase seems far-fetched, read this description of \\nMicrosoft’s founder, William Gates III, “Bill Gates eats competitors with the methodical determination of a corporate Pacman.”\\n1 Gates, it is true, is scarcely \\nrenowned for his environmental or social sensitivities. But in our rapidly evolving \\ncapitalist economies, where it is in the natural order of things for corporations to devour competing corporations, for industries to carve up and digest other \\nindustries, one emerging form of “cannibalism with a fork” — sustainable \\ncapitalism — would certainly constitute real progress. \\nThe fork, sustainability’s triple bottom line, is explained in Chapter 4. Its three \\nprongs are economic prosperity, environmental quality, and social justice. Cannibals \\nWith Forks identifies seven revolutions which are already beginning to transform the \\nworld of business and will help drive major corporations and leading economies \\ntowards these goals. The book, for reasons which will become apparent, is skewed \\nmore to the environmental dimension of sustainability than to the social or economic dimensions, but the integration of these different dimensions of the emerging \\npolitical agenda will be a central challenge for 21st century business. And we will \\nneed to maintain our focus and drive to sustain this agenda through the inevitable cycles of economic growth and recession, company mergers and demergers, public \\nenthusiasm and disillusion, government activism and passivity. \\nInevitably, a key part of the task will be effective stakeholder consultation.

Moreover, some are trying to work out ways of doing so on a continuing basis, not simply when in the throes of takeovers, mergers, or — as the \\nrecent history of companies like ICI, Hoechst, and Monsanto suggests will \\nincreasingly be the trend — demergers. \\nIn the following pages, I draw on firsthand experience over more than two \\ndecades with some of the world’s best-known corporations, national and \\ninternational government agencies, and non-governmental organizations, as they have struggled to embrace key elements of the sustainability agenda and to \\ninternalize a growing range of economic, environmental, and social costs. Most of \\nthese companies have acted because they have had previous, painful experience of what can happen when they, or other companies, misread or fail to act upon a major \\nnew economic, social, or political agenda. But growing numbers have also \\nresponded because they scented commercial opportunity. \\nMany of the case studies are drawn from companies with which SustainAbility \\nhas worked over the years, because these are the organizations I know best. \\nThroughout, I will name companies we have worked with, explaining some of the things that have gone right for them and some of the things that have gone wrong. \\nAlert readers will note that the geopolitical focus of the book is largely on Western \\nEurope and North America, where many of the relevant trend first surfaced. But our ability to deliver longer term stustainability will also depend heavily on our ability \\nto help switch on the capitalists, financial markets, entrepreneurs, managerial \\nclasses, and consumers of the emerging economies, developing nations, and less developed countries of the world. \\nAs I have mentioned, much of the work described in the following pages has \\nbeen carried out through SustainAbility, the London-based-think-tank and consultancy founded in 1987 with the triple mission of foresight, agenda setting, and \\nchange management. It is interesting, however, to recall the problems we had with \\nthe name. For several years, my colleagues and I spent much of our time, whether on the telephone or at conferences, spelling out and defining the Sword for people who \\nhad never heard it before. Indeed, a recent university computer search suggested that \\nour use of the word in this particular sense may have been the first in print. True or not, it was certainly among the first; hence our problems. \\nToday, the problem is very different, given that many people think they know \\nwhat “sustainability” means, yet define it in almost infinitely various ways.

As a result, we know what it takes to switch a company on to this \\ncomplex agenda, and we know many of the barriers which then need to be \\nsurmounted as the company struggles to make business sense of the sustainability agenda. \\nI first tried to work out what sustainable development might mean for business in \\nthe early 1980s following the publication of the 1980 World Conservation Strategy.\\n2 \\nAs a cofounder and later managing director of Environmental Data Services \\n(ENDS), I was involved in efforts to bring together leading companies with public \\nsector agencies and non governmental organizations. But this was still a very different world. When, in the wake of the Bhopal disaster, I sat down to write The \\nGreen Capitalists\\n3,’ the Berlin Wall was still standing and stood for several years \\nmore. The Soviet Union was more or less intact, Eastern Europe still under its thrall. Yet the broad shape of the future was already clear. \\nCapitalism, in its many forms, was the wave of the future. But then so, the book \\nconcluded, was sustainability. The Green Capitalists, which ended with a perspective by Tom Burke, who went on to advise three consecutive UK Secretaries \\nof State for the Environment, was first published in 1987. That year also saw the \\npublication of the World Commission on Environment and Development’s report Our Common Future,\\n4 which brought “sustainable development” into the vocabulary \\nof international politics. \\n“Perhaps, what we are seeing is the emergence of a new age capitalism,” Tom \\nconcluded on page 252 of The Green Capitalists: \\n \\n“appropriate to a new millennium, in which the boundary between corporate \\nand human values is beginning to dissolve. It is now clear from the results \\nwho won the nineteenth-century argument about capital and labour. \\nSocialism, as an economic theory, though not as a moral crusade, is dead. The argument now is about what kind of capitalism we want.” \\n \\nWe were interested in the central role of governments, but the real focus was on \\nthe emergence of a new breed of “green capitalist” (an oxymoron for which I must \\naccept responsibility), which we saw as an enormously hopeful trend.

       " Document(page_content='Foreword X \\nwith business and through markets, many of the changes we wanted to see simply \\nwould not happen. \\nRather than leave things to chance, I sat down with another colleague, Julia \\nHailes, and wrote The Green Consumer Guide5. The idea was that by changing the \\nconsumer choices we made every day, often without thinking, we could send \\npowerful signals to retailers and, through them, to the rest of the business world. And so it proved. Published in 1988, this book, and its various editions, sold around \\na million copies and, alongside US cousins like Shopping for a Better World\\n6 and 50 \\nWays to Save the Planet ,7 had an extraordinary impact. It helped catalyze a wave of \\ninternational consumer pressure on business. \\nBack in 1987, however, we had pointed out that “the ‘profitability’ of a given \\nbusiness very much depends on where those who run the business choose to draw their ‘bottom line’, with costs above the line and profits below.” A core concept \\nintroduced in Ca nnibals With Forks is that of the “triple bottom line,” against which \\nindividual businesses and, increasingly, entire economies will be held to account, and have to perform, as we move into the 21st century. Since we often find that a \\ndegree of humor helps to lubricate the thinking process, I offer on page xi the first of \\n19 Spotlight panels as a lighthearted aide memoire for readers trying to get their brains around this triple agenda. \\nBy turns critical and complimentary of the efforts of business to date, C annibals \\nWith Forks shows how far leading corporations have come, and how far they still \\nhave to travel to perform successfully against the triple bottom line. Over the years, \\nmy colleagues and I at Sustain-Ability have seen corporate cannibalism, and its \\neffects, at close quarters. For example, we have worked with a range of companies as they merged or de-merged: with Manweb as it was taken over by Scottish-Power; \\nwith Scottish-Power as it took over Southern Water; with BT as it merged with \\nMCI; with Volvo as it dallied with Renault; with Tioxide as it was sold to DuPont by ICI; and with Monsanto as it began to split up into life, science and chemical \\ncompanies. But, even so, C annibals With Forks is an optimistic book, accepting \\nthat, while corporate Cannibalism may not be pleasant to behold or comfortable to experience, it will remain an intrinsic part of any competitive economy. \\nThe challenge is to work out how we can get these corporations to embrace and \\nsustain a wider set of values. Is it possible, for example, to evolve new types of corporation which are less inclined to operate as economic, social, and ecological \\npredators? How can we restructure markets in such a way that sustainability begins \\nto make real business sense? Given that competition will always be one of the most powerful driving forces in biological, economic, and social systems, how can we get ', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 10}),\n",

And how can we \\nensure that corporations continue to build triple bottom line commitment and \\nperformance as they go through their inevitable cycles of growth and decline, expansion and downsizing, merger and demerger? \\nThe focus throughout the book is on some emerging forms of 21st century \\ncapitalism. The aim is to lay bare the nature, scale, and implications of the biggest,THE BARDOT FACTOR \\nFuture market success will often depend on an individual company’s (or entire value chain’s) ability to simultaneously satisfy not just the traditional bottom line \\nof profitability but also two emergent bottom lines; one focusing o\\nn \\nenvironmental quality, the other on social justice. As a result, companies and their boards will need to think in terms of the triple bottom line. \\nBut what does this triple bottom line look like in practice? To help memorize \\nthe logic, let’s resort to caricature. Think in terms of the “Bardot Factor.” Fil\\nm \\nactress Brigitte Bardot has been described as the second most famous French \\nperson in the world, after General de Gaulle, Her contributions over decades to \\nthe financial bottom lines of the film industry, St Tropez, and, indeed, the French economy itself are beyond dispute. She also wins in terms of the environmental \\nagenda, having emerged as a forceful animal rights campaigner \\nTwo bottom lines down, one to go. But here’s the problem. The erstwhile sex \\ngoddess, whose form inspired busts of Marianne, the female figure symbolizing \\nthe French Republic, has suffered the indignity of having some of the busts \\nremoved from town halls and replaced by others based on Catherine Deneuve. Despite her economic and environmental contributions, Bardot’s views o\\nn \\nimmigration, and her support for the extreme rightwing National Front party, \\nalienated many supporters. In short, the social justice dimension prevented he r \\nachieving a win-win-win outcome, \\nEnd of caricature. In today’s world, companies like Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, \\nShell, or Virgin depend for their success on their media profiles, on thei r \\nreputations, and, ultimately, on public, consumer, and investor trust. As we will \\nsee, growing numbers of companies already find themselves confronted by the \\nBardot Factor, requiring novel “triple win” strategies and partnerships designed to satisfy the triple bottom line of sustainable development.

Even so, making sense of, let alone \\nbeating the competition in, a 3-D world can be pretty complicated: ask anyone who \\nhas played 3-D checkers. Now sustainable capitalism, with its emphasis on the triple \\nbottom line performance of companies, industries, and economies, presents business people with an even more complex challenge: a 7-D world. \\nThe sustainability agenda, long understood as an attempt to harmonize the \\ntraditional financial bottom line with emerging thinking about the environmental bottom line, is turning out to be much more complicated than some early business \\nenthusiasts imagined. Increasingly, we think in terms of a “triple bottom line,” \\nfocusing on economic prosperity, environmental quality and – the element which business has tended to overlook – social justice. \\nTo refuse the challenge implied by the triple bottom line is to risk extinction. Nor \\nare these simply issues for major transnational corporations: they will increasingly be forced to pass the pressure on down their supply chains, to smaller suppliers and \\ncontractors. These changes flow from a profound reshaping of society’s expectations \\nand, as a result, of the local and global markets business serves. Anyone who has worked in this area for any time knows that there are waves  of change. Some of \\nthese waves, as we see in Chapter 2, are driven by triple bottom line factors – most \\nparticularly in recent decades by environmental pressures. To accept the challenge is to embark on a process which is likely to be both intensely taxing and, potentially, \\nhighly rewarding. With its dependence on seven closely linked revolutions, the \\nsustainable capitalism transition will be one of the most complex our species has ever had to negotiate.

For each \\ntransition, we will also spotlight the most important blind-spot which currently \\nimpairs the vision of business leaders. \\n \\n1 Markets \\nRevolution 1 (Chapter 5) will be driven by competition, largely through markets. For the foreseeable future, business will operate in markets which are more open to competition, both domestic and international, than at any other time in living \\nmemory. The resulting economic earthquakes will transform our world. \\nWhen an earthquake hits a city built on sandy or wet soils, the ground can \\nbecome thixotropic : in effect, it becomes fluid. Entire buildings can disappear into \\nthe resulting quicksands. In the emerging world order, entire markets will also go \\nthixotropic, swallowing entire companies, and even industries. Learning to spot the market conditions and factors which can trigger this process will be a key to future \\nbusiness survival, let alone success. As we will see, some analysts predict that global \\nfinancial markets will begin to behave like “super-conductors,” with changes that would once have taken months or even years now happening in the space of days, \\nminutes, or even seconds. \\nIn this extraordinarily challenging environment, growing numbers of companies \\nare already finding themselves challenged by customers and the financial markets \\nabout aspects of their triple bottom line commitments and performance. Although \\nwe will undoubtedly see continuing cycles based on wider economic, social, and political trends, this pressure can only grow over the long term. As a result, business \\nwill shift from using competition as an excuse not to address the triple bottom line', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 18}),\n",

Most business people, indeed most people, take values as a given, if \\nthey think about them at all. Yet our values are the products of the most powerful \\nprogramming that each of us has ever been exposed to. When they change, as they seem to with every succeeding generation, entire societies can go thixotropic. \\nCompanies that have felt themselves standing on solid ground for decades suddenly \\nfind that the world as they knew it is being turned upside-down, and inside out. \\nRemember Mrs Aquino’s peaceful revolution in the Philippines? Or the \\nextraordinary changes in Eastern Europe in 1989? Recall the experiences of Shell \\nduring the Brent Spar and Nigerian controversies, with the giant oil company later announcing that it would in future consult non governmental organizations on such \\nissues as environment and human rights before deciding on development options. \\nThink, too, of Texaco. The US oil company paid $176 million in an out-of-court settlement, in the hope that it would bury the controversy about its poor record in \\nintegrating ethnic minorities. Just as financial markets can turn into quicksands or \\nsuperconductors, so can entire business environments and, indeed, societies. \\nSuch shifts in values are among the most powerful influences faced by \\npoliticians and business leaders alike. Swimming against the tide can be difficult, if \\nnot impossible, although swirling eddies may sometimes make it seem as though the process is going into reverse, back towards the comforting certainties of “business as \\nusual.” Companies misreading the direction of flow risk running aground or being \\nswept aside into the commercial doldrums. \\nThe transition from “hard” commercial values to “softer” triple bottom line \\nvalues does not mean that life will become any easier for business; far from it.

When Nature published the news that a Scottish lamb, number 6LL3 \\nbut better known by her alias, “Dolly,” had been cloned, it triggered an ethical earthquake.\\n1 As the tempo of such announcements builds, ethical issues will \\ncontinuously be in the public eye. But, in the process, which values will win out? \\nWill a new morality — or moralities — evolve, or will most people ;imply regard such events as one more form of soap opera? \\nCannibals With Forks suggests that we are already seeing the emergence of a \\nnew — or renewed — set of values, many of which will be central to the sustainability transition. No one imagines that we will ever reach the point where \\neveryone on the planet shares a common set of values, but there is very likely to be \\nconvergence around at least a minimum set. This trend is likely to be critical as companies increasingly come to see their future as global. Although many triple \\nbottom line campaigners see globalization as inimical to an economically, socially \\nor environmentally sustainable future, this is the direction we will be driven in for decades to come. “Customer requirements dictate that we operate globally so that \\nboundaries don’t limit the best thinking, the best people or the best solutions,” \\nexplained IBM senior vice-president Ned Lautenbach.\\n2 \\nGlobalization has economic, social, and environmental dimensions. But the \\nnotion that sustainable development has a social dimension is still controversial. \\nThis is worrying. As Professor Tom Gladwin of New York University’s global environment program puts it, while sustainability is often thought of as “eco-\\nefficiency for the rich,’’ this definition is dangerously narrow. “Sustainable \\ndevelopment is more than that,” Gladwin stresses. “It’s equity, justice, alleviation of poverty, and redistribution of opportunity.”\\n3 \\nNor are all business people fighting this analysis every step of the way. \\n“Sustainable development requires collaborative thinking and partnerships with other non-business organizations,’’ accepts Björn Stigson, executive director of the \\nWorld Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). “These \\npartnerships only make sense in the global scheme: to address poverty in the Third World, as much as to deal with pollution control.” Stigson warns that “business can’t \\ntackle all the issues, nor can it do it alone,” but observes that “the most enlightened', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 20}),\n",

This is the context within which \\nsustainable development must be put into practice. The concept of sustainability is entering the business language at different speeds in different parts of the world, \\nwith current and emerging values acting as brakes, gearboxes or accelerators. As a \\nresult, our focus in future must not only be on changes in technology and in management systems, but also on values and mindsets. “My principal concern,” says \\nWhitman Bassow, long with the New York-based World Environment Center, “is \\nthat the emphasis is on changing the engineering of manufacturing, on things but not the attitudes of the people who produce the products, nor their behavior, nor the \\nresistance to change inherent in human nature.”\\n4 \\n \\nBlind-spot 2 The worst blind-spot today’s business leaders suffer from in this area \\nis that the business of business is about the creation of economic value, and not \\nabout social or ethical values. This is not particularly surprising: a full generation of business leaders have been taught to stay out of politics and that they meddle in the \\naffairs of governments (even oppressive regimes) at their peril. It is clear that \\nattempts to drive corporations towards sustainability objectives and targets will trigger both action and reaction, support and resistance. Managing these trends and \\ncounter-trends will involve working with both individuals and groups to help them \\nchange their mindsets and, even more importantly, to transform the corporate culture. As a result, the sustainability transition will be as much a political transition \\nas it will be an economic or social transition. \\n \\n3 Transparency \\nRevolution 3 (Chapter 7) is already under way, is being fueled by growing \\ninternational transparency and will accelerate. As a result, business will find its \\nthinking, priorities, commitments, and activities under increasingly intense scrutiny worldwide. Some forms of disclosure will be voluntary, but others will evolve with \\nlittle direct involvement from most companies. In many respects, the transparency \\nrevolution is now “out of control.” \\nThis process is itself being driven by the coming together of new value systems \\nand radically different information technologies, from satellite television to the', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 21}),\n",

The collapse of many forms of traditional authority also means that a wide \\nrange of different stakeholders increasingly demand information on what business is \\ndoing and planning to do. Increasingly, too, they are using that information to \\ncompare, benchmark, and rank the performance of competing companies. \\nCompanies that have previously sought to justify no disclosure or low-disclosure \\npolicies will find that they — and their entire value chains, linking suppliers and \\ncustomers — are increasingly operating in a global goldfish bowl. They face growing pressures for right-to-know legislation and new corporate governance rules. \\nAs a result, the difficulty of keeping secrets will become immeasurably greater. \\nSooner or later, most things a company thinks or does it will become public knowledge. Companies that fail to plan with this fact in mind must be prepared to \\npay the price. \\nBut as more and more companies start to report elements of their triple bottom \\nline commitments, targets, and performance, the field remains haunted by a paradox. \\nAs illustrated in Figure 7.1 (p. 171), corporate reporting has often outrun supporting \\nactivities in such areas as accounting, management systems, and auditing (see Chapter 3). This is perhaps not surprising, but the lack of synchromesh is emerging \\nas a major barrier to progress. \\nThe 21st century will see various reactions to these elevated levels of \\ntransparency.

Instead, the \\nevidence increasingly suggests that even companies that normally operate well outside the spotlight — and therefore often have little or no experience of dealing \\nwith the new stakeholders and their complex, interlocking agendas — will find \\nthemselves inexorably drawn into the wrenching controversies triggered by the sustainability transition.

Companies are being challenged about the triple bottom \\nline implications of either industrial or agricultural activities far back down the \\nsupply chain, or of their products in transit, in use, and, increasingly, after their useful life has ended. Here we are seeing a shift from companies focusing on the \\nacceptability of their products at the point of sale to their performance from cradle to \\ngrave and, increasingly, from cradle to cradle; i.e. from the extraction of raw materials right through to recycling or disposal. Managing the lifecycles of \\ntechnologies and products as different as batteries, jumbo jets and offshore oil-rigs \\nwill become increasingly challenging, transforming key elements of R&D and product design processes. \\nNew techniques are being developed to explore and, to a growing degree, \\nmeasure the economic, social, and environmental impacts of new technologies, products, and processes. Most of these tools have been hugely expensive and have \\noften produced confusing results, but they are beginning to escape from the \\nlaboratory environment to the market. In the process, they will mutate and evolve in unexpected ways. The surging power of computers and growing use of the Internet \\nare parallel trends which are likely to further amplify developments in this area. As a \\nresult, companies operating in a wide range of different industries will suddenly find themselves exposed to a new form of “X-ray environment,” in which their value \\nchains and product lifecycles will be exposed (often in excruciating detail) to wider \\nscrutiny. \\nEarly environmentalists were often anti-technology, in addition to being anti-\\nindustry, anti-growth and anti-profit. But over a couple of decades our interest in \\nsuch appropriate low technologies as biomass digesters and small-scale windmills has expanded to include everything from satellite remote sensing (great for \\nmonitoring environmental change) and supercomputers (handy if you are trying to \\nmodel such complex systems as the atmosphere or a rainforest) through to new materials (which hold the key, for example, to lightweight, hyper-efficient vehicles) \\nand molecular engineering (which could enormously boost the benefits of chemistry \\nwhile cutting out most of the unwanted side-effects). \\nChapter 8 introduces the “Need Test,” which all technologists should test their \\nnew ideas against.

Ensuring that the gene revolution works with, rather than against, the grain of the \\nsustainability revolution is one of the greatest challenges ahead of us. \\n \\nBlind-spot 4 The worst blind-spot today’s business leaders in companies suffer \\nfrom in this area is the assumption that their responsibilities end at the factory fence, \\nand that any triple bottom line impacts of their operations, products, or services will be sorted out in the “normal course of events.” In today’s business environment this \\na potentially fatal delusion.

Organizations which \\nonce saw themselves as sworn enemies will increasingly flirt with, and propose new forms of relationship to, opponents seen to hold some of the keys to success in the \\nnew order. As even groups like Greenpeace gear up for this new approach, we will \\nsee a further acceleration of the trends driving the third and fourth sustainability revolutions. \\nEarly on, some companies contented themselves with trying to mimic some \\naspects of their opponents’ behavior, in the hope of developing a form of camouflage. The late 1980s and 1990s, for example, saw a number of companies \\ntrying to position themselves as “corporate environmentalists.” Assumed by many \\ncampaigners to be little more than a case, of corporate camouflage, “greenwashing,” this trend reflected a new sense of mission in some parts of the business world. \\nIndeed, some companies — among them BAA, RTZ and Shell — have recruited \\nindividuals who once ran anti-industry campaigns. Discussions of whether we are seeing “watchdogs turned lapdogs” can blind us to the fact that some of these people \\nare having a real influence in their new organizations.

None of this means that we will see an end to friction or even outright conflict. Instead, \\ncampaigning groups will need to work out ways of simultaneously challenging and \\nworking with the same industry, or even the same company.

Such tensions are likely to grow when the focus of the partnerships inevitably expands to embrace an integrated triple bottom line approach.

Probably not, but current trends suggest that business is beginning to wake \\nup to the necessity of change, and to the scale of the challenge. Ironically, however, \\nmany of those who are advising major corporations have yet to understand fully what is beginning to happen around them. \\nWhen I was still a boy in shorts, Nikita Kruschev, then President of the \\nseemingly unstoppable Soviet Union, grabbed the world’s headlines by saying that communism would bury capitalism. No doubt he believed it and much of the rest of \\nthe world feared he might well be right. Capitalism, whether in the Soviet Union or \\nin other major industrial powers, had a decidedly mixed press for generations. In Das Kapital  (1867) Karl Marx wrote that “capital is dead labor that, vampire-like, \\nlives only by sucking living labor, and lives the more, the more labor it sucks.” \\nReally, who would want to live in a capitalist society? And, for much of the 20th century, many critics of the industrialized world order wondered aloud — \\nsometimes very loudly — whether the future would be unsustainable capitalist or \\nsustainable communist? \\nBy the time I went to university in the late 1960s, many baby-boomers were in \\nthe thrall of sundry gurus, from Marx and Mao Tsetung to Herbert Marcuse and Che \\nGuevara. Their basic message was that capitalism’s time was tip. My taste, instead, was for people like Paul Ehrlich, Barry Commoner and Teddy Goldsmith: \\nenvironmental thinkers who argued that the combined trajectories of population \\ngrowth, industrial pollution, and ecosystem destruction threatened to undermine the future, whether capitalist or communist.

Then came the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the subsequent collapse of much of the communist system, spotlighting the \\nequal, and often greater, vampirism of most state-run economies. A few people had \\nseen the collapse coming, recognizing that communism, too, had its internal contradictions, but for most people it came as one of the greatest surprises of the \\nmost surprising century on record. \\nThe parallel “environmental revolution,” also reaching its second great peak in \\n1989 (see Chapter 3), exposed the increasingly aggressive predation of the natural \\nworld by industry, whether capitalist or communist.

The sustainability crisis is going to get a lot worse before we have any hope of turning the corner. As a result, the trends identified in the following pages look set to turn the world of business inside out over the next \\nfew decades.

The world is \\ngoing to be prepared to pay people who can help it survive.” At the same time, the \\nworld will be increasingly willing to hammer those whose business activities or plans threaten, or are seen to threaten, our future. Monsanto, for example, has been \\nhammered in Europe on its plans to introduce such genetic engineering products as \\nbovine somatotropin (BST) and herbicide-resistant soybeans. \\nParadoxically, this period of history will be extraordinarily demanding for the \\nmovement that got the bandwagon started.

Sustainability is the principle of ensuring that our actions \\ntoday do not limit the range of economic, social, and environmental options open to \\nfuture generations.  \\nWhy is it important? Simply stated, this is the emerging 21st century business \\nparadigm. Sustainable development is proposed by governments and business \\nleaders as a solution for a wide range of problems now racing up the international \\nagenda. These range from global worming, ozone depletion, and the collapse o f \\nsome ocean fisheries through to social problems such as the deaths of 37, 000 \\nchildren under the age of five every day (mostly from diseases for which there are \\ninexpensive cures) and the death of some 585,000 pregnant women and mothers \\nevery year. The first UN Global Environmental Outlook  report, published in 1996, \\nargued that the world still locks ‘the necessary sense of urgency” needed to pull \\nback from the “environmental precipice.” \\n What has this got to do with business?  Many business people will argue that it is \\nrot their business to save the world. But the expectation is growing around the world \\nthat business will deliver. In part, this flows from the activities of organizations like the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), but it also \\nflows from a recognition that business needs stable markets — and, uniquely, has \\nthe technology, finance, and management skills needed to achieve the sustainabilit\\ny \\ntransition. The triple bottom line agenda (see Chapter 4) is fast evolving — and on a \\nbroad front, with one of the most challenging tasks being that of coordinated \\ndelivery, to ensure both efficiency and effectiveness in resource use.  \\nIsn’t this a job for the law-makers and regulators?  In part, of course, it is. Bu\\nt \\nindustry’s often effective lobbying over the years for less regulation and, in some cases, active deregulation may now be coming back to haunt it. \\n \\nWall Street won’t let us do this!  Wrong.

These trends will eventually impact all sectors of \\nthe global economy, without exception. But groups like Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) now face changes in their \\nown environments every bit as extraordinary as those that rocked IBM as the era of \\n“Big Iron” gave way to the era of the PC — and those that then rocked Microsoft as the era of the PC, in turn, began to give way to the era of the Internet. \\nBut, surely, things are getting better? In some key respects, they are. But ask \\nmost environmental or sustainability experts whether they think things are improving overall, and the most common answer is absolutely not. When Japan’s \\nAsahi Glass Foundation sent out its fourth annual questionnaire on “environmental \\nproblems and the survival of mankind” in 1995, it mailed a total of over 2,500 forms to experts and opinion-formers in 201 other countries. Asked to say how concerned \\nthey were in terms of a 12-hour clock, their average response was 8:49; close to the \\n“extremely concerned” range of 9.01–12.00. Since the survey first started, the average response has shifted to one hour later, indicating growing concern. \\nWhen asked about conditions in 50 years time, over 50 per cent of respondents \\nbelieved that conditions would be worse. They may well be right, but, given that pessimism can act as a self-fulfilling prophecy, the challenge now is to develop a \\nmore optimistic vision of the future and the social, economic, and environmental \\nstrategies needed to make it a reality. As we enter the third millennium, sustainability potentially provides us with a powerful framework for doing just that. \\nUpsides, Downsides \\nTrojan Horse? \\nLet’s look at some of the downsides first. For several decades, business has mainly focused on the downside of the environmental revolution. This has also been true of the sustainability revolution, which really began to take hold from 1987. And, at \\nleast for some, the short-term downside was real enough, and intensely personal. \\nOne UK director of a US corporation we worked for in the early 1990s flew across the Atlantic to explain the sustainability imperative to the US board.

By the end, his colleagues told us, he was all but dragged out of the room \\nfeet first. \\nThe problem was that some corporate Americans saw sustainability as a plot, a \\nlate twentieth century version of the Trojan Horse. They argued that Gro Harlem \\nBrundtland, the Norwegian Prime Minister who had chaired the World Commission \\nof Environment and Development, was a quasi-communist and that the Commission’s report, Our Common Future,\\n1 was little more than a ploy to transfer \\nadvanced US technology to the Third World for free. Ironically, the company was \\nalready an acknowledged leader in terms of pollution control. But its knee-jerk reactions to sustainability were repeated in boardrooms across the USA and in some \\nEuropean member states. \\nThings have changed in the intervening years, of course. But nowhere near as \\nfast as they need to, despite the fact that any business that ignores the trends outlined \\nin the following pages risks committing commercial suicide.

As Fortune  recently put it: \\n \\n“Corporations were put on this earth, after all, to make money, and to some \\nminds, profit maximization will never seem all that different from greed. But \\nprofits, of course, pay for the latest equipment and technology that produce economic growth and more jobs. If corporations weren’t greedy like that, \\nthey’d go out of business and then we’d all be in trouble.”\\n2 \\n \\nWell maybe. But the sustainability lobby points out that we are in trouble \\nalready, often because of the self-interested way in which most corporations have \\ninterpreted their missions. So, it asks, can the capitalist system change not only its spots but also its very nature? Can these corporate cannibals, in short, not only learn \\nto use more civilized tools but also begin to shift their diet towards inputs that are \\nless economically, socially, and ecologically damaging? \\nMeanwhile, although it is far from clear that capitalism is significantly more \\nenvironmentally damaging than the alternatives, it has been in the spotlight recently \\nboth because of its rising global power and because of what some would have us believe is the “end of history.” In 1989, Francis F ukuyama wrote an influential \\narticle arguing that the world was seeing the development of a quite remarkable \\nconsensus on the legitimacy of liberal democracy as a system of government. This system, he suggested, had conquered rival ideologies such as hereditary monarchy, \\nfascism, and communism. In this narrow sense, he believed that we were seeing the \\nend of history, the “end point of mankind’s ideological evolution” and the “final form of human government.” \\nThe almost immediate crackdown by the Chinese communists after the \\nTiananmen Square protests in 1989, and the 1991 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and ensuing Gulf War led many critics to argue that Fukuyama — who followed up with', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 38}),\n",

Certainly, the potential for “rogue” states to develop their own nuclear, chemical, or biological arsenals appears much greater \\nnow that many of the defence industry skills of the old USSR are available on the \\nopen market. In this context, any transition to more sustainable forms of economic development will have to cope with — and may even trigger — major political \\ndislocations. If we fail to wake up to and manage these challenges in time, they may \\nwell derail key elements of the sustainability transition. \\nBut, whatever the foreign policy outlook and implications of such trends, the \\n“free” market is now the pre-eminent development model in most world regions. \\nWhen, for example, the central bank chairmen from five of the largest post-communist countries — Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Hungary, and Romania — \\nrecently spelt out their monetary policies for the investment elite of the World \\nEconomic Forum, those present were delighted at how boring the speeches were. \\n“There is no longer a debate about economic theory,” commented Rodric \\nBraithwaite, a former UK ambassador to Russia who had moved on to Deutsche \\nMorgan Grenfell. “The fundamentals are not contested anymore.”\\n4 \\nSo capitalism it is, but we are seeing an interesting shift towards a debate about \\nthe limits and weaknesses of market mechanisms. One of the most forceful recent \\nbooks on the theme is Robert Kitten’s Everything for Sale.5 Markets work much \\nbetter than command-and-control economies in most respects, but as Kuttner puts it, \\n“A society that was grand auction block would not be a political democracy worth \\nhaving.” As a result, as we will see in Chapter 6, there is a now a resurgence of the debate about a broader range of human and societal values — and about ways in \\nwhich they can be integrated into the operation of international markets and of the \\ncorporations that serve them. \\nStripped to its essence, capitalism — of whatever brand — is an economic (and, \\nnecessarily, political) system in which individual owners of capital are (relatively) \\nfree to dispose of it as they please and, in particular, for their own profit. As we will see, there are many different ways of calculating, defining and valuing capital, but a \\nkey question for all capitalist societies in the 21st century will be whether their \\nparticular version can be sustained in the face of broader economic, political, social, and environmental challenges?

Wealth creation is rarely \\na comfortable process and the world’s capitalist societies have been undergoing a \\nperiod of wrenching change. Nor are the most urgent problems facing politicians and business leaders related to environmental or sustainable development pressures, at \\nleast as conventionally defined. \\nThe problem is deeper still in the eyes of many of those running the capitalist \\nsystem. Even in the USA, capitalism now faces a fundamental challenge to the \\nlegitimacy of the largest corporations and to the way rewards are distributed in the \\nfree enterprise system. This is because of the perception that stock markets boost shares and reward executives (through stock options) when they lay off workers. \\nIndeed, there are echoes of the time earlier this century when Teddy Roosevelt and \\nothers campaigned against what Roosevelt dubbed the “malefactors of great wealth.”\\n6 \\nIn Japan, too, waves of corporate restructuring have caused a spate of suicides \\namong middle-aged corporate samurai. Until recently, the goals of corporations and employees coincided. “Workers look to the company rather than their families or \\nother activities for self-fulfilment,” explained Makoto Nakume, a psychiatrist who \\ncounsels stressed office workers.\\n7 But, increasingly, we live in what Business Week  \\ndubbed “The Age of Anxiety.”8 Everywhere, the threat of unemployment is felt to \\nbe imminent. Sometimes the casualties of change are small, but sometimes they are \\nlarge enough to shake an entire nation. In the Netherlands, for example, enormous shock-waves followed the announcement by Germany’s Daimler-Benz AG that it \\nplanned to pull the Plug on NV Fokker, the loss-making, cash-strapped aircraft \\nmaker — a move it was thought could cost the country a total of 20, 000 jobs.\\n9 \\nNone of this is new, of course. More than 50 years ago, economist Joseph \\nSchumpeter noted that the essential feature of the capitalist system is “creative \\ndestruction,” which he defined as an organic process of “industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionises the economic structure from within, incessantly \\ndestroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one.”\\n10 But one of the most \\nworrying aspects of the latest wave of mutations has been that many of the layoffs have been permanent, not temporary as was the case during the recession of the mid-\\n1970s.

As a result, it seems likely that the \\ninternal political challenges to the capitalist system will grow as the communist threat hopefully recedes and the pace of economic change accelerates in response to \\nthe process of globalization. Among the most urgent warnings of the dislocations \\nthat the globalizing market will trigger in the future is William Greider’s One World, \\nReady or Not; “If I am compelled to guess the future, I would estimate that the \\nglobal system will, indeed, probably experience a series of terrible events — \\nwrenching calamities that are economic or social or environmental in nature — before common sense can prevail.”\\n11 \\nWhat Are the Implications? \\nThe economic and social dislocations now reeking all industrial nations make for an extremely unsettled political environment within which to attempt to pursue long-term goals such as sustainability, Partly as a result, business will find itself in a now, \\nmore central position. The relative weakening of government influence and control \\nas globalization proceeds will ensure that business will increasingly be held to account for issues which would once have been seen as political — and therefore, \\nnecessarily, the preserve of government. \\nSome may even see this as a desirable outcome. Capitalism has proved itself \\nperhaps uniquely capable of reinventing itself when presented with apparently \\ninsuperable threats and constraints. We have seen the raw capitalism of the \\nIndustrial Revolution progressively molded into new forms of “social,” “green,” or, increasingly, “stakeholder” capitalism. Hopefully, over the next few generations, we \\ncan also evolve “sustainable” forms of capitalism. \\nOne key shift that will drive us in this direction is the awakening of financial \\nmarkets to key elements of the triple bottom line agenda over the next decade. The \\nscale of the losses sustained to date by the insurance industry are mind-numbing. For \\nexample, as much as a fifth of the losses which rocked Lloyd’s insurance market to its financial foundations were linked to policies covering risks related to asbestos, \\nsoil contamination, and toxic or radioactive wastes, but now something new is \\nlooming on the horizon. When Hurricane Andrew hit Palm Beach, Florida in 1992, Lloyd’s of London was devastated once again. Underwriters and “Names” alike \\ncould only watch their TV monitors in horror as houses and cars went flying.

The \\nreal fear was that such hurricane damage might be linked to the global warming \\ntrend, implying that future losses would be on an even greater scale.12 \\nThe insurance industry is determined not to be taken by surprise again. As a \\nresult, it is investing considerable sums of money in global climate modelling. Some \\nforward-looking insurers are now leading the charge in the financial markets to \\nensure that industry is alert to environmental risks and that it is investing sufficient time, effort, money, and other resources to keep the risks to an acceptable level. \\nSome, too, are sitting down with groups like Greenpeace and exploring ways in \\nwhich they can work together to drive the necessary changes. \\nThe problem is that even the very largest, global corporations have little control \\nover key elements of the sustainability agenda. Which is unfortunate for them. For, \\nwhile the world is increasingly persuaded that sustainable development is a necessary direction, politicians rarely yet have the vision, let alone the courage, to \\nsteer their governments, parties, and electorates in this new direction. As a result, it \\nis inevitable that a growing portion of the sustainability agenda will land, by default, in the lap of business and of what is increasingly called “civil society;” all the \\ninstitutions and public activities which create the social context within which \\nmarkets evolve and business is done. \\nThe Politicians \\nWhat do Politicians Say? \\nWith a few honourable exceptions, politicians say as little as they can get away with. \\nBut every so often, a major world leader breaks rank and tells it as they — or their \\ntrusted advisers — see it. Early cases were the “green” speeches of Prime Minister Thatcher and Presidents Gorbachev and Bush in the late 1980s. The 1992 Earth \\nSummit in Rio de Janeiro also saw over a hundred world leaders lining up for their \\nfew minutes in the spotlight and, for the most part, reading the words scripted for them by others. Very few, insulated by their air-conditioned, body-guarded \\nexistences, seemed able to draw on much in the way of relevant personal experience. \\nThen came one of the more extraordinary developments of the first Clinton \\nAdministration in the USA: the eleventh-hour conversion of Secretary of State \\nWarren Christopher to the environmental cause.

The very nature of his job meant that he had traveled the world constantly \\nand, in the process, had been briefed on the issues most taxing the governments he \\nwas negotiating with.14 \\nCynics saw as significant the facts that Christopher would probably retire after \\nthe 1996 election (he did) and that there would be no comprehensive Middle East \\npeace deal before he left office: politicians like to leave a legacy. Whatever his \\nmotives, he did just that. He ordered the State Department to produce an annual report on global environmental challenges, echoing an annual report on human \\nrights. And he also called for a system whereby the main US embassies in each \\nglobal region would establish environmental centers, to raise the profile of natural resources issues and the sustainability agenda. \\nIt is interesting to recall how many experiences helped open his eyes. One was \\nwalking, just a month before, through the children’s ward of a hospital treating patients from around the Chernobyl nuclear plant. Another was working his way \\naround the Middle East, where he constantly came across problems of soaring \\npopulations and limited water resources. His brief on the prospects for the central Asian republics spotlighted “Soviet irrigation policies that turned much of the Aral \\nSea into an ocean of sand.” The message was clear. “I kept running into political or \\nsecurity problems that had a very large environmental content,” he recalled. “Haiti stuck in my mind, with the overpopulation and deforestation of that country. And, in \\neastern Europe, those new democracies are struggling with a legacy of \\nenvironmental abuse — and may never recover. \\nNor were these the only issues. “We must not forget the hard lessons of Rwanda, \\nwhere depleted resources and swollen populations exacerbated the political and \\neconomic pressures that exploded into one of the decade’s great tragedies,” he continued. Christopher became more engaged the more he heard, said one aide: \\n \\n“He heard in one briefing that by the year 2025, there would be more people \\nliving in cities than are currently alive. He heard in another briefing, on the \\nflood potential from global warming, that 40 per cent of all cities are on coasts \\nor tidal estuaries. He put those two together, and began diving into the reading list.” \\n \\nHe was streets ahead of most politicians in that respect. \\nAnd then there is China.

As Christopher put \\nit: \\n \\n“With 22 per cent of the world’s population, China has only seven per cent of \\nits fresh water and cropland, three per cent of its forests, and two per cent of \\nits oil. The combination of China’s rapid economic growth and surging \\npopulation is compounding the enormous environmental pressures it already faces.” \\n \\nTibet is unlikely to be the last country to feel the impact of China’s lebensraum \\npolicy,  as the country’s giant population seeks new lands in which to live and from \\nwhich to draw sustenance. \\nMany critics remain skeptical, however, knowing the unspoken rule of politics; \\n“real men don’t do environment.” But Warren Christopher helped to open up the \\nway for others, further legitimizing the sustainability agenda as a key item on the \\npolitical agenda for the 21st century. This is an interesting contrast to the perspectives afforded to business leaders by most of the management consultants to \\nwhom they pay so much attention and money. \\nThe Management Gurus \\nWhat do Consultants Say? \\nConsultants say too much, according to some, and surprising numbers change their \\nminds a few years later. But there are many helpful gurus and, good or bad, these \\npeople are listened to by those corporate leaders.

Like many others, I quarried \\nelements of the book that took my fancy, coining the phrase “environmental \\nexcellence” in the subsequent WICEM report. \\nIn Search of Excellence went on to sell over 6 million copies: good news for the \\npublishers, but not for the environment. The book did nothing to advance the \\nWICEM agenda, failing to make even a single passing reference to the environmental agenda. But, that sorry state of affairs is now changing. Some modern \\nmanagement gurus — including Michael Porter (see p. 108) — are beginning to pay \\nserious attention to the environment, others to sustainable development, and others still are beginning to use ecological metaphors in outlining the winning business \\nstrategies of the future. \\nSo in each chapter, we take a look at what business gurus are saying, and then \\nconsider, by way of contrast, what the much smaller number of environmental and \\nsustainable development gurus have to offer. Most of the mainstream gurus, it turns \\nout, have had very little to say to date about sustainability. Where the S-word is used, as by senior McKinsey consultants Lowell Bryan and Diana Farrell in Market \\nUnbound,\\n18 it is typically used in a different sense. \\nBut probably the biggest recent tome on the subject of capitalism is George \\nReisman’s 1,046-page Capitalism .19 This is strongly recommended reading for \\nanyone interested in the subject, but listen to what Reisman has to say on the subject \\nof environmentalism, which he concludes is the greatest current threat to capitalism. “The green movement,” he argues, “is the red movement no longer in its boisterous, \\narrogant youth, but in its demented old age.” Reisman, in short, seems to exhibit \\nexactly the same mental disease that business people have long accused environmentalists of suffering from: a pathological inability to distinguish the g ood \\nfrom the bad in a target population. \\nSo why bother reading some of this stuff? The answer is that when we consider \\nthe prospects for the seven “sustainability revolutions” covered in Chapters 5–11, \\nwe need to take into account the advice which business leaders are currently \\nreceiving from this quarter. There is fierce competition not only between products and between services, but also between rival ideas and the linked ideologies. \\nMercifully, after a decade of books on “reengineering” and “downsizing,” a new \\nwave of strategy gurus are developing such concepts as “coopetition,” “coevolution,” “business ecosystems,” and “value migration,” all of which, it turns \\nout, are strongly related to the triple bottom line agenda.

Thurow, professor of management and \\neconomics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Dean of MIT’s \\nSloan School of Management from 1987 to 1993, compares the shifts in today’s global economy with ideas taken from the natural sciences.\\n22 \\nOne of these is “plate tectonics” from geology, where spectacular earthquakes \\nand volcanoes are seen as linked to the thrusting of underlying continental plates. Another is “punctuated equilibrium” from biology, which accepts that evolution \\noccurs very slowly in the normal course of events, but suggests that every so often \\nthere is a dramatic change in the environment, with the result that species that were highly fit in the old world order die out and are replaced by something quite \\ndifferent. \\nFive fundamental economic forces are now responsible for changing the face of \\nthe world economy and pushing us towards a period of punctuated equilibrium. As a \\nresult, we live in highly uncertain times. “We are watching the ‘dinosaurs’ die,” \\nThurow says, “but we don’t know what will take their place.” The five great changes driving this great economic convulsion are: \\n \\n♦ The end of communism. A third of humanity used to live in the old \\ncommunist world — and are now beginning to play a growing part in the \\nglobal economy. \\n♦ The shift from an economy based on natural resources to one based on brain \\npower. \\n♦ Demography, in the senses that there is likely to be a 50 per cent increase in \\nworld population by 2030, a huge increase in economic migration, and a \\n“greying” of the populations of most industrialized nations. \\n♦ The development of a global economy. Increasingly, anything can be made \\n— and sold — almost anywhere. But as the old rules, based on the GATT—Bretton Woods System, become redundant and the world breaks up into \\ntrading blocs where there will be freer trade within the blocs and more \\ngovernment management between them, there is no guarantee that effective new rules will replace them. \\n♦ There is no longer, Thurow asserts, a dominant economic, political, or \\nmilitary power. But what happens if, and when, China takes over as the world’s largest economic and, very possibly, political superpower?

       " Document(page_content='Is Capitalism Sustainable? 35 \\nIn China, Thurow notes, one of the worst things you can say to your neighbors is, \\n“May you live in interesting times.” The Chinese know that fundamental uncertainty \\nis among the worst things we can experience. Capitalism, in short, has a future but \\nfor most of us the next couple of decades will be extremely interesting times. And the early decades of the 21st century will be even more “interesting” for the \\ncorporate brain because of the failure of most corporate advisers to understand — \\nand alert their clients to — the profound, inevitable implications for their clients of the impending sustainability revolution. \\nThe Business World \\nWhat do Business Leaders Say? \\nIn truth, most business leaders have still not even got as far as avowing that they are, really, environmentalists at heart. Take Steven Spielberg and his colleagues at DreamWorks (Case Study, p. 36). They tried this approach when they ran into heavy \\nenvironmental flak, but found it hardly helped them. More directly engaged is Intel \\nchief executive Andy Grove, whose book, Only the Paranoid Survive,\\n23 notes that \\nthe challenge in today’s markets is to find rational ways to survive what he calls the \\n“ 10x” — or tenfold — factors that can change everything almost overnight. \\nExamples have included the arrival of sound in the movie industry, the transformation of the computer industry in the late 1980s, and the breakup of \\nAT&T’s telephone monopoly. \\nIt is interesting to note that Intel was also one of the first companies in the world \\nto be targeted by campaigners operating over the Internet (Case Study, p. 168), \\nbringing an issue which once would have been purely local on to a much wider \\nstage. But it is not yet clear from Andy Grove’s writings or public pronouncements whether or not he suspects that the sustainability challenge might represent one of \\nthose “10x” shocks for Intel and for its customers and suppliers. This conclusion, as \\nthe companies involved in organizations like the World Business Council for Sustainable Development are beginning to recognize, is entirely reasonable — and \\nsupported by a growing body of evidence. \\nThe Sustainability Century \\nWho Will Win, Who Lose? \\nIt is not yet remotely clear whether capitalism can ever become sustainable, as that \\nterm is currently understood.

When movie mogul Steven Spielberg, record boss \\nDavid Geffen, and former Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg joined forces to \\nform DreamWorks, a new Hollywood studio designed to take the film industr y \\ninto the digital age, the world of cinema and TV  viewers looked forward to furthe r \\nblockbusters from the maker of box-office smashes like Raiders of the Lost Ark  \\nand Jurassic Park . Yet a few months later, Spielberg and his colleagues were cos t \\nas the villains in one of LA’s most dramatic environmental controversies. \\nThe controversy was even more media-worthy because of the involvement o f \\nMicrosoft chief Bill Gates and cofounder Paul Allen among Spielberg’s co-\\nvillains. At stake was the future of an area called the Ballona Wetlands. Ballona is a corruption of the Spanish ballena, or whole, and the 1,087 acre site just north o\\nf \\nLA international airport is home to a huge number of species. There are 128  birds \\nspecies, five of them endangered; 35  mammal species; 13  types of reptiles and \\namphibians; and nursery grounds for ocean fish. The 329  recorded plants include \\nmedicinal herbs still used by the Shoshone people, who lived here long before the \\nearly Spanish colonists arrived and forced them into the San Gabriel mission. Problematically, too, the site is also said to contain a Shoshone Gabrielino \\ncemetery. \\nThe time-bomb that DreamWorks detonated when it announced plans to build \\nPlaya Vista, an “electronic garden city,” on the site clearly had been primed \\ncenturies back. The developers’ lawyers made things worse by refusing to believe \\nthat there had been burials there, demanding that the 400-strong tribe prove thei\\nr \\nclaim. Chief Vera Rocha refused, saying that to do so would violate the sanctity o f \\nthe dead. Significantly, perhaps, Californian low rules that six Caucasian groves \\nmakes a cemetery, but the rule does not apply to Indians. \\nWork was to have begun on the site, which also has a long history as a \\nHollywood studio backlot, in the summer of 1996 . Then a coalition of 38  \\nenvironmental groups and Shoshone Gabrielino native Americans blocked the project — handing in a petition signed by a million people and, perhaps more \\nsignificantly, launching a series of lawsuits (against DreamWorks and calling for a \\nboycott of Spielberg’s Jurassic Park  sequel. \\nMatters were made worse by the fact that the billionaires behind DreamWorks \\nhad beer offered a $44 million, tax-free subsidy by the city authorities, who at the \\nsome time closed a hospital for lack of funds.

Its real strength is that, more \\nthan any other model subjected to large-scale testing, it promises to helps harness \\nhuman creativity and innovation to the sustainability cause. \\nDespite the fact that very few modern business bestsellers even mention the \\nenvironmental and sustainability challenges, among the most deep-seated trends that \\nwill make business life increasingly “interesting” are the seven impending “sustainability revolutions” spotlighted in Chapters 5–11. These seven revolutions \\nare not sufficient conditions for global sustainability, even when taken together, but \\nthey will most certainly be necessary conditions. \\nEven companies like DreamWorks and Intel, at the very heart of the emerging \\neconomy and thought by many to be infinitely more environment-friendly than the \\nsteelworks and auto-makers of the past, have been among the recent casualties of environmental controversies. But the focus of today’s debate is no longer simply on \\nerrant corporations, but on the sustainability of the emerging capitalist world order. \\nMarx, it turns out, was right in much of his analysis but his prognosis was deeply \\nflawed; Kruschev’s, too. Even so, the last thing 21st century corporations will be \\nable to do is put their corporate feet up. On top of all the other changes under way, \\nthe sustainability transition will destroy some industries and force the radical restructuring of others. It will be the unmaking of tens of thousands of companies \\nand businesses around the world. But it will also provide the seedbed conditions for \\nhundreds of thousands, indeed millions, of new businesses. Chief Rocha claimed that the Ballona site was “cursed” for the white man, a \\ngraveyard of their dreams. Drawing on late 20th century mythology, he also suggested that Spielberg see again the 1982 film Poltergeist,  which focused on a \\nfamily haunted after occupying an Indian burial site. It was at this backlot, i\\nn \\n1924, that newspaper tycoon Randolph Hearst is tho ught to have accidentall y \\nshot Tom Inca when Hearst caught Charlie Chaplin in flagrante  with his mistress \\nMarion Davies. Later, Howard Hughes housed his ill-fated giant “Spruce Goose” \\nseaplane here. It took off just once, with Hughes struggling at the controls, and managed to get only a few feet above the water. \\nWhether or not DreamWorks finally gets off the ground at Ballona, the \\ntravails of Spielberg, Gates, and partners — most of whom claim to be environmentalists at heart — spotlighted the complex dynamics (economic, \\nsocial and ecological) of late 20th century environmentalism. \\n ', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 51}),\n",

He was \\nhelped by the fact that his 20,000 overachievers were convinced that they — indeed \\nwe — are moving into the “Microsoft Century.” Maybe so, but it is even more likely to be the “Sustainability Century.” \\nCompanies able to engage their stakeholders with a clear vision of their shared \\nfuture and, in the process, to outperform their competitors against the triple bottom line will be much better placed to win people’s hearts and minds — along with their \\nmoney. Readers wanting to get straight to the heart of the matter of the triple bottom \\nline agenda should now turn to Chapter 4. Those wanting a personal perspective on the trends, events and turning points that lie behind the evolving triple bottom line \\nagenda should turn to Chapter 3. \\nBut recognize that we are still a long way from sustainability. Systems thinking \\ntells us that sustainability cannot be defined for a single corporation. Instead, it must \\nbe defined for a complete economic—social—ecological system, and not for its \\ncomponent parts.\\n24 Think of an industry directly based on a renewable natural \\nresource, such as the fishing industry. A captain of a fishing vessel might fish for his \\nentire life without depleting fish stocks in an area, but if he were joined by a \\nsufficiently large fleet of identical vessels, the fishery could be destroyed. The behavior of the captain and his vessel would not have changed, but in the first case it \\nwould be sustainable and in the second not. \\nWorse, as Paul Hawken has pointed out in The Ecology of  Commerce,\\n25 is that: \\n \\n“we are faced with a sobering irony: If every company on the planet were to \\nadopt the environmental and social practices of the best companies — of, say, the Body Shop, Patagonia, and Ben and Jerry’s — the world would still be \\nmoving toward environmental degradation and collapse.” \\n \\nUltimately, Paul Hawken argues, the problem we face is not so much a \\nmanagement problem as a design problem. “In order to approximate a sustainable \\nsociety,” he concludes, “ we need to describe a system of commerce and production in which each and every act is inherently sustainable and restorative.” This is the \\nchallenge implicit in the sustainability transition. Even the best companies, as \\nChapter 13 explains, will only be sustainable when the institutions and markets surrounding them have been redesigned to support and promote sustainability.\\n26', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 52}),\n",

Once rated a low priority corporate citizenship issue, the sustainable development agenda is in the process of becoming a competitive and \\nstrategic issue for major tracts of industry and commerce. \\nThe past three decades have seen environmentalism emerge as the most \\npervasive new social movement of the post-1945 period.

This is an era of \\nspecialists, each of whom sees his own problem and is unaware or intolerant of the larger frame into which it fits. It is also an era dominated by industry, in \\nwhich the right to make a dollar at whatever cost is seldom challenged.” \\n \\nTABLE 3.1 Wave 1 (peak 1969–73) \\n Environmentalism Mainstream 1970 Earth Day, USA 1970 Goddhafi takes power in Libya 1972 UN Stockholm Conference 1972 US troops leave Vietnam 1972 Limits to Growth, Blueprint for Survival  1973 Watergate scandal \\n1973 OPEC 1 oil shock 1973 Yom Kippur war ', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 60}),\n",

In The Environmental \\nRevolution,5 Max Nicholson noted that the public had become uncomfortably aware \\nof the downside of scientific and technological progress. “The pride of having \\nreached the moon,” he suggested, “is cancelled out by the humiliation of having gone so far towards making a slum of our own native planet.” It had taken a \\nconsiderable number of years for this first great wave of concern to build, but \\nNicholson was writing just as the wave reached its peak. “Old values, habits of thought  and established practices are being challenged all over the world,” he \\nreported. \\nIn 1961, aged 10 or 11, I recall raising money for the newly founded World \\nWildlife Fund (now the Worldwide Fund for Nature). WWF was a wildlife \\nconservation organization, whose founders — Peter Scott and Max Nicholson \\namong them — were mavericks but also very much establishment figures and pro-business. But, as Nicholson himself concluded, “revolutions, unfortunately, have a \\nway of overtaking the revolutionaries, defeating their attempts to understand or \\ncontrol what is going on, and baffling or alienating those at the receiving end.” Indeed, a new breed of environmentalist would soon be bursting upon the scene, \\nwith the formation of such organizations as Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace. \\nBut, first, let’s take a brief look behind the scenes. \\n \\nMidwife to the Greens? \\nFew people, not even leading environmentalists, were aware that modern environmentalism had been sparked by the behind-the-scenes work of an unassuming British scientist, James Lovelock. Because Lovelock’s work has helped \\ndrive each successive wave of environmentalism, his story is worth briefly \\nsummarizing here. I first came across Lovelock’s work in 1976, when New Scientist \\npublished an article on his “Gaia Hypothesis.” But, even then, Lovelock’s \\ncontributions to the environmental world dated back almost three decades. In 1948, \\nwhen looking for the causes of the common cold, he built a piece of equipment which would become the precursor of the environmental revolution. \\nEarly in the 1990s, I nominated Lovelock for the Volvo Environment Prize. In \\n1996, he won the prize and, in his nomination lecture in Brussels, reviewed the history of that early invention, the electron capture detector (ECD) and its \\ncontribution to the evolution of the green movement.\\n6 In 1949, he recalled, the', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 61}),\n",

Here it was soon found to have a worrying sensitivity: cigarette smoke \\nupset its delicate workings. Lovelock tried out other gases, to see whether this was a \\npart of a more general problem. It was. Among the different gases to which the instrument was acutely sensitive were CFCs — chlorofluorocarbons. \\n“We did not at that time need a device to detect low levels of halocarbons,” \\nLovelock recalled, “and so the electron capture detector was in a sense prematurely discovered.” What he had, in fact, invented was “the most sensitive, easily portable \\nand inexpensive analytical device in existence.” Indeed, as he explained, the ECD is \\n“exquisitely sensitive. If a few litres of a rare perfluorocarbon were evaporated somewhere in Japan we could with little effort detect it in a 100 cubic foot sample of \\nthe air here in Brussels a few weeks later.” \\nSoon, serious scientists were applying the detector to the practical analysis of \\npesticide residues in foodstuffs. In the USA, scientists at the Food and Drug \\nAdministration (FDA), and in the UK scientists at Shell, did work which helped to \\nspawn the environmental movement. It was discovered that chemicals like DDT and dieldrin could be found throughout the global environment; in the fat of Antarctic \\npenguins and in the milk of nursing mothers in Finland. Enter Rachel Carson. \\nLovelock supported her work and recalls that: \\n \\n“some parts of the chemical industry r eacted in a shameful and foolish way by \\ntrying to discredit her as a person. It did not work. Quite the reverse. It made Rachel Carson the first saint and martyr for the infant and innocent Green \\nmovement.” \\n \\nSpaceship or Global Village? \\nNor was it simply a matter of one new instrument being developed. Someone else \\nwho captured key aspects of what was going on in the infosphere was Marshall \\nMcLuhan, who immortalized the phrase “the medium is the message” in the early 1960s. McLuhan was so preoccupied with the social implications of the burgeoning \\nweb of electronic communications technology that he overlooked the environmental \\nimplications. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that the environmental impact of the mass media and communications revolution was a special case of the \\ngeneral trend which McLuhan had identified.\\n7 ', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 62}),\n",

This necessary \\ndevelopment has come much more recently, with the emergence of technologies like the electron capture detector, satellites,  personal computers, and the Internet.

The environment slipped down the political agenda, a trend \\neagerly exploited by industry lobbyists. Not that this meant that the environment slipped completely off the business agenda. In 1978, for example, the Brussels based \\nManagement Centre Europe carried out a survey of chief executives in eleven \\nEuropean countries.\\n10 At the time, Europe was “barely emerging from the most \\nsevere economic recession since the 1930s.” Competition with major trading \\npartners, most particularly the USA and Japan, was forcing massive restructuring of \\nindustries like textiles and shipbuilding. Yet environmental protection, it turned out, was seen as a more pressing management issue, for the period 1973 to 1978, than \\nconsumer protection, high levels of unemployment, the demands of organized labor, \\nand even shareholder relations. \\nThe 1970s had certainly been a busy time for environmental legislators. The \\nperiod saw the formation of the first of hundreds of national environmental \\nprotection agencies, ministries, and departments. Ironically, even though the first wave had begun to fall back in 1974, its political impact continued for many years. \\nWhen the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) \\npublished its first state of the environment report in 1979, it included a listing of the new laws passed in OECD countries during the decade. The figures showed that the \\ntrend really took off in 1972, with the period between 1972 and 1976 representing \\nthe peak years. \\nFollowing the second OPEC oil shock of 1978–79, the downwave took hold in \\nthe USA during the early 1980s, under President Ronald Reagan and, in the UK, \\nunder Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. “Environmentalists tremble” read one headline in science  shortly after the election of Ronald Reagan as President. If they \\ndid, they had good reason to do so: the ex-actor had been, to put it mildly, an \\nuninspiring candidate as far as environmental issues went. At one stage, he went as far as to assert that trees were a major source of air pollution. He also claimed that \\nair pollution was under control — on the same day that a pea-soup photochemical \\nsmog prevented his plane from landing at Los Angeles airport.\\n11 \\nThe Republicans took their lead from a crop of think-tank reports which had \\nargued that regulation was almost an un-American activity.

As you look at the polls, the young people feel a lot more strongly about environmental issues than the age group that will be represented in the \\ngovernment leaders in the next four years. I don’t think society is going to \\npermit a turning back of the clock.” \\n \\nBut that did not stop the Republicans. Indeed, an editorial in the New York Times \\ndescribed the ensuing chaos at the agency as follows: \\n \\n“Seldom since the Emperor Caligula appointed his horse a consul has there \\nbeen so wide a gulf between authority and competence. Mr. Reagan’s EPA appointees brought almost no relevant experience to their jobs. His \\nadministrator, Anne Burford, was a telephone company attorney and two-term \\nlegislator who learned about environmental issues fighting Clean Air Act provisions in Colorado.” \\n \\nNot surprisingly, environmentalists saw these appointments as equivalent to \\nputting foxes in charge of the chicken-houses. They were not far wrong: the \\nresulting scandals rocked the EPA. Its staff halved at a time when its responsibilities \\nmore or less doubled. The American experience, as usual, simply took a trend to extremes. \\nNo-one disputed that the USA had introduced an unprecedented succession of \\npowerful and sweeping new regulations since the late 1960s. And there was a growing body of opinion that the time had come for the whole process of \\nenvironmental regulation and enforcement to be streamlined or “fine-tuned.” Indeed, \\nthe incoming administration had used such words to describe its intentions. But like the knights who assassinated Thomas à Becket in 1170, Burford and others took \\ntheir instructions too literally. President Reagan, like Henry II, eventually found \\nhimself having to do penance for the resulting damage. \\n \\nWhat is Zero? \\nThe ability to measure vanishingly small quantities of toxins inevitably led to over-reactions. “Before the ECD was used,” as Lovesick explained: \\n \\n“it would have been quite. easy and reasonable to set zero as the lowest \\npermissible limit of pesticide residues in foodstuff. Zero really means the least', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 66}),\n",

After the electron capture detector appeared, zero as a \\nlimit became so low that to apply it in full would cause the rejection of nearly \\neverything that was edible. Even natural vegetation contains measurable levels \\nof pesticides, so sensitive is the device.” \\n \\nWhile the world struggled with this new problem, however, Lovelock was \\nalready accidentally stumbling on a new one. In 1968, the year we baby-boomers were taking to the streets in protest against the Vietnam War and other issues, \\nLovelock’s family bought a holiday cottage in far western Ireland, on the shores of \\nBantry Bay. He noticed that the air was sometimes clear, and sometimes hazy so that objects less than a mile away became invisible. “The haze looked and smelt to me \\njust like the photochemical smog of Los Angeles,” Lovelock recalled, “but how \\ncould it have reached this remote rural region?” Next summer, he lugged a portable gas chromatograph on holiday. To cut a long story short, he found that the smog was \\ncoming from as far away as Southern France and Italy. More significantly still, his \\nequipment picked up startlingly high levels of CFCs in what was meant to be clean Atlantic air. \\nSo where were the CFCs coming from? Were they drifting across the Atlantic \\nfrom America, or were CFCs — whose only source was industry — accumulating in the atmosphere? To find out, Lovelock put together an ECD instrument able to \\nmeasure parts per trillion of gas and sailed to the Antarctic with it. What he found \\nalong the way lit a fuse which would eventually blow up, once again, under the embattled chemical industry. The data were used by two American scientists, \\nSherwood Rowland and Mario Molina, to develop a theory on ozone depletion \\nwhich — after much controversy — destroyed the future of the global CFC industry.\\n12 This issue helped catalyze the second great wave of environmentalism, \\njust as the ECD data on pesticides had catalyzed the first wave. \\nAnyone for Clean Technology? \\nThroughout the first downwave, the continuing activities of environmentalists and \\nregulators kept the pressure on environment-intensive industries. Among other \\nthings, they promoted energy efficiency and clean (or cleaner) technologies. One \\ncompany which took the US EPA at its word when it began to talk in terms of “zero emissions” was 3M. During the 1970s, the company asked Dr Joseph Ling, then its \\nvice-president for environmental engineering, to review the costs of meeting existing \\nand likely new laws. The conclusions were grim.

       " Document(page_content='Sustaining Capitalism 54 \\nDr Ling concluded that traditional pollution control technologies were already \\nconsuming financial and other resources at an uneconomic rate. Worse, if \\nenvironmental standards continued to rise, as seemed likely, the total costs would \\nincrease exponentially as companies tried to remove the last few percentage points of pollution. 3M came up with a radically different approach. As part of its new 3P \\n(Pollution Prevention Pays) program, it adopted the following formula: “Pollution \\n(waste materials) + knowledge (technology) = potential resources.”  I first came \\nacross the 3P story thanks to Michael Royston, author of Pollution Prevention \\nPays,\\n13 who I had first met in Iceland in 1977. \\nThe major thrust of the 3P program, which soon saved 3M many hundreds of \\nmillions of dollars worldwide, was directed into reformulating products, modifying \\nprocesses, redesigning equipment, and recovering waste materials for re-use. As one \\nexample, 3M switched from a cotton herbicide which generated 12 pounds of pollutants per pound of product to one which generated two pounds per pound of \\nproduct — and was also cheaper to make. \\nParadoxically, the good news started to flow during the downwave. In fact, in \\n1978 Max Nicholson, David Layton and I were the founders of Environmental Data \\nServices, a new company dedicated to researching and communicating best business \\npractice. But the good news was accompanied by a steady stream of bad news. Among the issues on the environmentalist agenda were the following: \\n \\n♦ The world’s population had swelled from about 1.6 billion in 1900 to 5.2 \\nbillion by 1990 — and looked set to exceed 8 billion by the year 2025. \\n♦ Largely because of human pressures, it was estimated that the world was \\nlosing about a hundred species of all kinds every day. In 1987 alone, up to \\n50 million acres of species-rich tropical forest were estimated to have been \\ndestroyed. \\n♦ Oil was still being spilled into the oceans at ten times the rate of the already \\nsubstantial natural seepage from oil fields. \\n♦ In Europe, the proportion of forests showing damage caused by acid \\ndeposition had grown from 8 per cent in 1982 to 52 per cent in 1988. More than a third of Europe’s forests were thought to be blighted by acid \\npollutants — and the situation in Eastern Europe was turning out be even \\nworse. \\n♦ In 1987 alone, human activity added the equivalent of 6.5 billion tonnes of \\ncarbon to the atmosphere — in the form of carbon dioxide and other \\ngreenhouse gases. This represented more than 1.25 tonnes for every person on the planet.

The \\n“Brundtland Report” put sustainable development — a concept which had been \\naround at least since 1980 — firmly onto the international political agenda. \\nSustainable development was defined as “development that meets the needs of \\nthe present world without compromising the ability of future generations to meet \\ntheir own needs.” Key objectives, the Brundtland Commission noted, include the following: reviving economic growth, but in a new form (“less material- and energy-\\nintensive and more equitable in its impact”); meeting essential needs for jobs, food, \\nenergy, water, and sanitation; ensuring a sustainable level of population; conserving and enhancing our natural resource base; reorienting technology and managing risk; \\nand merging ecological and economic considerations in decision making. \\nThe Commission argued that feeding, clothing, housing, transporting, and \\nfueling the expanded world population will imply a 5–7-fold increase in industrial \\nproduction by the middle years of the 21st century.

There was a greater focus on solutions, altho ugh the organizers still \\nhad great difficulty in working out how to involve major corporations without \\ncompromising themselves. Earth Day 1990 got campaigns, initiatives, and stunts off \\nthe ground in over 130 countries. At the time, like many others, I felt that we were on a roll that would continue at least until 1992, the year of the long-planned Earth \\nSummit. I was wrong. The second downwave was about to hit. \\nThe Second Downwave \\nSummit in a Downwave? \\nUnlike the UN Stockholm conference twenty years earlier, the 1992 Earth Summit \\nwas held against the background of the worst international recession of the post-\\n1945 period. Two locomotives of economic growth in the 1980 — the German and \\nJapanese economics — were almost derailed. Even on government estimates, nearly 20 million Europeans found themselves unemployed. Ordinary citizens became \\nmuch more concerned about holding onto their jobs and with finding affordable \\nproducts than about protecting the environment. The second downwave probably began by the end of 1990, and was certainly well under way by 1991 — when the \\nworld began to run into a number of other major issues, among them the Gulf War, ', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 72}),\n",

The environmental and sustainability agendas had not so much disappeared as been professionalized. A \\ngreat deal was now happening behind the scenes. The paradoxical implication was \\nthat if growth resumed on the old pattern, environmentalism would likely enjoy a resurgence — and do so from a much higher base of public support, professionalism, \\nand influence than in previous business cycles. \\nOne of the more interesting moments of 1992 came with the publication of \\nBeyond the Limits,\\n18 by some of the same team that had given us Limits to Growth \\ntwenty years earlier. Again, the conclusions reached were unsettling. “The human \\nworld is beyond its limits,” we were told: \\n \\n“The present way of doing things is unsustainable. The future, to be viable at \\nall, must be one of drawing back, easing down, healing.

But the late 1980s had seen \\nbusiness investing a growing amount of energy and senior management time, via \\norganizations like the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and the Business \\nCouncil for Sustainable Development (BCSD), in preparing its position for the 1992 Earth Summit. Ironically, as we have seen, the second great green wave peaked in \\nlate 1990 or early 1991, well before the Earth Summit, leaving many business \\ninitiatives hanging in mid-air, without the political and market pressures to properly sustain them. \\nThis time, however, there was a much more powerful ratchet effect at work. \\nPerhaps a key reason for this was that the second wave had hit business much harder than it had hit governments. The president of the ICC noted that “the withering away \\nof the Marxist challenge leaves the environmental challenge as the most \\nfundamental one that business [people] all over the world are going to face in the foreseeable future.”\\n19 \\nFrom the Bhopal disaster onwards, we had seen growing numbers of companies \\n— most particularly US chemical companies like Dow Chemical, DuPont and Monsanto — committing themselves to environmental targets that began to take \\nthem well beyond what the regulators currently required. There was much talk of \\nmoving “beyond compliance” and of a new mood of “corporate environmentalism.” Business leaders began to recognize the need for business people to act as \\nenvironmentalists, rather than simply as professional, with environmental \\nresponsibilities. “No corporation can be truly innovative until everyone in the company has adopted an environmentalist attitude,” said Edgar Woolard, as \\nchairman and CEO of DuPont. In the spirit of the times, Woolard also said that, at \\nleast in his case, CEO stood for “chief environmental officer.” \\nAs we will see, this sort of claim was more than a little optimistic. But at least \\nthe conversion was now under way — and the second downwave simply slowed \\nprogress, rather than sending it into a tailspin. Business leaders, increasingly, recognized the need to “change course,” to use the phrase introduced in 1992 by the \\nBusiness Council for Sustainable Development’s 1992 book, C hanging Course.\\n20 \\nAmong the BCSD’s key messages were:  \\n♦ as the world moves inexorably towards deregulation, private initiatives, and \\nglobal market, economic growth and environmental protection will be inextricably linked; ', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 74}),\n",

Then the giant oil company became the target for an unprecedented international campaign as the Nigerian government \\nexecuted environmental activist Ken Saro-Wiwa and his colleagues.

He was incandescent with anger at the French and very much on the side of Greenpeace in this latest dispute. \\nTime and again, we saw leading politicians beginning to be dragged into the \\ndebate. Britain’s then Prime Minister, John Major, clashed with Germany’s Chancellor Helmut Kohl over Brent Spar. President Chirac collided with Europe’s \\nPresident Jacques Santer on nuclear testing.

What, they wanted to know, was going on? Together with Paul Hawken and Geoff Lye, I spent a fascinating couple of days \\nworking through the evidence with top executives from Shell International.

Ordinary people were now much more aware of the \\nissues than they had been. They wanted to see the problems addressed, but desirably by someone else. The events of the 1990s had made them less confident that green \\nconsumerism and similar types of pressure would — at least in isolation — bring the \\nnecessary changes. This gap between their longer-term environmental concerns and their current unwillingness to act created a certain psychic friction, producing the \\nequivalent of a static charge. When a potential scapegoat came along, the \\naccumulated energy could discharge with surprising force. This was not the third tidal wave, we concluded, but a necessary series of precursor seismic events. \\n \\nWill Gaia Surf the Next Wave? \\nThe third wave, I suspect, will again owe a good deal to Jim Lovelock. This time, \\nhowever, the catalyst he has contributed is an idea rather than a piece of equipment. \\nWorking for NASA, Lovelock began to wonder about life on earth. Working with \\nLynn Margulis, he developed the idea that the Earth might regulate its own climate and chemistry at a state favourable for the organisms that inhabit it. “I may be wrong \\nbut I do think that this idea, which the novelist William Golding suggested I call \\nGaia, has been my most useful contribution,” he explained. \\nLovelock first put forward the Gaia hypothesis as early as 1969, as the first wave \\nbuilt towards its peak. Together with Margulis, he defined Gaia as “a complex entity \\ninvolving the Earth’s biosphere, atmosphere, oceans and soil; the totality constituting a feedback or cybernetic system which seeks an optimal physical \\nenvironment for life on this planet.” \\nGaia, Lovelock suggested in his 1979 book of the same title,\\n22 “is an alternative \\nto that pessimistic view which sees nature as a primitive force to be subdued and \\nconquered.” Unlike most reductionist science, and this is the reason why I believe \\nthat Lovelock’s thinking will be fundamentally important in the 21st century, Gaian science is not neutral. Vaclav Havel, then President of the Czech Republic, gave a \\nspeech when he received the Freedom Medal of the USA. Havel said that Gaia was \\npart of a new science that offers moral guidance. It gives us something to which we are accountable.

Twenty years ago, when I began to grill companies \\nabout their environmental problems, most loathed the idea of environmentalists getting anywhere inside the factory fence, let alone into the headquarters \\nbuilding. Anyone sporting an environmental label was assumed to be going fo\\nr \\nthe throat. You counted yourself lucky if you got to speak to a public relations executive or environmental lawyer, even though you knew they were paid to \\nkeep you at arm’s length. \\nLater, in energy companies like BP and British Gas, you met like-minded \\npeople whose working lives involved carrying out environmental impac t \\nassessments for major project proposals. They, at least, understood the issues. \\nBut their job was to shoe-horn new developments into the environment, no t \\nconsider their sustainability or challenge the underlying need for such \\ndevelopment. \\nThen came the late 1980s. Suddenly, the green world overflowed with exotic \\nbusiness breeds: new product development people, designers and — above all — \\nmarketers. Few were committed environmentalists: what they really wanted to \\nknow was how to give their products a sharp green spin into the marketplace. Many ended up in the ditch with their wheels spinning. \\nNow the not-so-random thought.

The reason is that we are increasingly deliberating such questions as wha\\nt \\ncompanies are for, how they should meet stakeholder needs and expectations, \\nand how they must be configured to succeed during the sustainability transition. \\nIn the water industry, the regulators now insist that water efficiency is give n \\na high priority.

The answer, almost \\ncertainly, is that they are not. Indeed, it is interesting that the Commission of the European Communities, in its White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and \\nEmployment,\\n23 spoke of the need to develop and adopt a “new model of \\ndevelopment.” Specifically, the Commission foresaw a growing imbalance in the main factors of production — land, labor, and Capital. \\nFor decades, the substitution of labor by capital, via technology, has been \\naccompanied by growth in the use of energy and other raw materials, leading to the over-exploitation of increasingly scarce environmental resources, Because market \\nprices do not adequately reflect the scarcity of many natural resources, nor the \\nenvironmental opportunity costs involved in using such resources for short-term economic gain, the Commission notes that “their over-use has become systematic.” WaterWise information pack, offering everything from the Triple Wax Dri-wash (clean your car without water) to miracle watering cons,” whose push-butto\\nn \\ndevices ensure water goes where it is needed. Small beer, perhaps, but with \\nalmost a third of Anglian’s customers admitting they waste “a lot” of water, such \\nmeasures are timely. \\nLonger term, however, the route to sustainability will run through \\ntransformed water markets. Companies must learn how to earn more by selling \\nless. Facing inexorably rising demand and an uncertain supply picture, Anglia n \\nis already pondering “demand side management.” “Our normal response to the \\nproblem of a village with periodic water supply difficulties is to lay a large r \\npipeline,” the company’s water efficiency plan notes, “whereas a cheaper and more environmentally sensitive solution may be to reduce demand in that village \\nby checking all the domestic supply pipes for leaks and fitting water-efficien\\nt \\nappliances.” \\nFine, but how can we convert all consumers to water-efficiency? One wa y \\nforward is obviously to install water meters. Anglian’s current plan is to mete r \\n95% of properties by 2015. And there’s the rub: most consumers still see clean, almost free water as a right. This must — will — change. Watching the foa\\nm \\nspiraling beneath our feet, I concluded that this was indeed what the first two \\nwaves of environmentalism were about: transforming leading companies into vigorous, effective campaigners for resource efficiency and sustainability.

Some of the most interesting challenges, \\nhowever, are found not within but between the areas covered by the economic, \\nsocial, and environmental bottom lines.

But the sustainability agenda, long \\nunderstood as an attempt to harmonize the traditional financial bottom line with \\nemerging thinking about the environmental bottom line, turned out to be more \\ncomplicated than some early business enthusiasts had imagined.

As far as they, and the thousands of companies which have signed up since, were concerned, the \\nbasic challenge was simply one of “greening,” of making business more efficient \\nand trimming costs. \\nWhen the Harvard Business Review turned its spotlight on to the sustainability \\nagenda in 1997, ten years after the publication of Our Common Future, it noted that, \\n“Beyond greening lies an enormous challenge — and an enormous opportunity. The challenge is to develop a sustainable global economy: an economy that the planet is \\ncapable of supporting indefinitely.”\\n2 This represents a profound challenge. Although \\nsome parts of the developed world may be beginning to turn the corner in terms of ecological recovery, the planet as a whole is still seen to be on an unsustainable \\ncourse. \\n“Those who think that sustainability is only a matter of pollution control are \\nmissing the bigger picture,” explained Stuart Hart, director of the Corporate \\nEnvironmental Management Program at the University of Michigan: \\n \\n“Even if all the companies in the developed world were to achieve zero \\nemissions by the year 2000, the earth would still be stressed beyond what \\nbiologists refer to as its carrying capacity. Increasingly, the scourges of the late twentieth century — depleted farmland, fisheries, and forests; choking \\nurban pollution; poverty; infectious disease; and migration — are spilling over \\ngeopolitical borders. The simple fact is this: in meeting our needs, we are destroying the ability of future generations to meet theirs.” \\n \\nAnd these problems are not simply economic and environmental, either in their \\norigins or nature. Instead, they raise social, ethical, and, above all, political issues. \\nThe roots of the crisis, Hart concluded, are “political and social issues that exceed \\nthe mandate and capabilities of any corporation.” But here is the paradox: “At the same time, corporations are the only organizations with the resources, the \\ntechnology, the global reach, and, ultimately, the motivation to achieve \\nsustainability.” \\n There is no question that some of these issues can have — indeed, already have \\nhad — a profound impact on the financial bottom line.

But,” he \\nstressed: \\n \\n“the positive case is even more powerful. The more we learn about the \\nchallenges of sustainability, the clearer it is that we are poised at the threshold \\nof an historic moment in which many of the world’s industries may be transformed.” \\n \\nThe level of change implied by the sustainability transition is extraordinary. As \\nthe Worldwatch Institute put it in a recent State of the World report: \\n \\n“We are only at the beginning of this restructuring. New industries are \\nemerging to reestablish natural balances — based on technologies that can \\nproduce heat and light without putting carbon into the atmosphere; on metals \\nmade out of the scrap of past buildings and cars; on papers made out of what was once considered wastepaper. Some homes and offices are heated entirely \\nby the sun or from electricity generated by the wind.”\\n3 \\n \\nBut sustainable capitalism will need more than just environment-friendly \\ntechnologies and, however important these may be, markets which actively promote \\ndematerialization.

The main shearzones are illustrated in Figures 4.5–4.7. \\nThe Economic Bottom Line \\nLet’s begin in the area where business should feel most at home. Given that we are \\nusing the “bottom line” metaphor, however, we need to understand exactly what it \\nmeans in its traditional usage. A company’s bottom line is the profit figure used as the earnings figure in the earnings-per-share statement, part of standard accounting \\npractice. In trying to assess a company’s conventional bottom line performance, \\naccountants pull together, record and analyze a wide range of numerical data. This approach is often seen as a model for environmental and social accounting, but the \\nchallenge can be even tougher in these emerging areas of corporate accountability.\\n4 \\n \\nEconomic Capital \\nSo how should a would-be sustainable corporation assess whether its business operations are economically sustainable? Obviously, a critical first step is to \\nunderstand what is meant by economic capital. In the simplest terms, your capital is the total value of your assets minus your liabilities. In traditional economic theory, \\ncapital as a factor of production can come in two main forms: physical capital  \\n(including machinery and plant) and financial capital . But as we move into the \\nknowledge economy, the concept is gradually being extended to include such \\nconcepts as human capital — a measure of the experience, skills, and other \\nknowledge-based assets of the individuals who make up an organization. We will also consider the intellectual capital concepts adopted by companies like Skandia. \\nAmong the questions business people need to ask in this area are the following. \\nAre our costs competitive — and likely to remain so? Is the demand for our products\\n', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 88}),\n",

How can we ensure that human or intellectual capital does not migrate \\nout of the organization? Are our profit margins sustainable?5 Longer term, too, the \\nconcept of economic capital will need to absorb much wider concepts, such as natural capital  and social capital , both of which are discussed below. \\n \\nAccountability \\nIn most countries, companies have an obligation to give an account of their financial \\nperformance. In the case of limited companies, directors are accountable to \\nshareholders. This responsibility is partly discharged by the production and — in the \\ncase of public companies — publication of an annual report and accounts. An annual general meeting (AGM) theoretically provides shareholders with an opportunity to \\noversee the presentation of audited accounts, the appointment of directors and \\nauditors, the fixing of their remuneration, and recommendations for the payment of dividends. \\nTypically, there has been little, if any, overlap between the areas covered by \\nfinancial auditors in serving the interests of shareholders and the issues of interest to other stakeholders in terms of the environmental and social bottom lines. But one \\narea where we see a growing degree of overlap between a company’s economic and \\nenvironmental performance is “eco-efficiency” (Spotlight, p. 78). At the same time, too, there are early signs that, as the sustainability agenda becomes a board-level \\nissue, we will see growing overlaps with the whole corporate governance agenda \\n(see Chapter 11). \\n \\nAccounting \\nBy the very nature of their work and training, most traditional accountants are short-sighted. Typically, the so-called accounting period is 12 months. Internal accounts are often prepared on a monthly or quarterly basis, with full results produced \\nannually. Worldwide, however, the pressure to perform on a quarterly basis is \\nintensifying as Anglo-Saxon approaches to stock management and investment banking spread. \\nIn preparing their accounts, accountants are guided by a range of reasonably \\nwell-established concepts. These include the ongoing concern concept (with  assets \\nnot stated at breakup value, unless there is evidence that the company is no longer', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 89}),\n",

One of the most thought-provoking books of the 1990s was Accounting \\nfor Growth , in which Terry Smith stripped away the camouflage of creative \\naccounting and helped shareholder, analysts, and others to assess how strong a particular company’s finances really are.\\n6 \\nWe have tended to see the bottom line as the hardest of realities, representing the \\nunappealable verdict of impartial markets.7 But it is increasingly clear that such \\naccounting concepts are man-made conventions that change over space and time. \\nBottom lines are the product of the institutions and societies in which they have \\nevolved. And, because accounting inevitably involves compromises, the bottom line turns out to be influenced by subjective interpretation, quite apart from “creative” \\naccounting. So, for example, when Rover was taken over by BMW and subjected to \\nGermany’s stricter valuation criteria, a 1995 “profit” £9l million became a £58 million “loss.” \\nA key concept in relation to all three dimensions of sustainability — but \\nparticularly relevant in relation to environmental and societal costs — is that of “externalities.” These economic, social, or environmental costs are not recorded in \\naccounts. So, to take an economic example, the decision of a company to locate a \\nhigh-technology plant in a relatively undeveloped region may have such effects as drawing technical talent away from local firms, or forcing up property prices locally \\nbeyond what local people can afford. We will look at examples of environmental \\nand social externalities under the appropriate sections below. \\n \\nIssues and Indicators \\nThese are key tools of the trade.

Internal audits aim to ensure that management controls are working effectively. External audits involve an independent \\nexamination of — and an expression of an opinion on — the financial statements of \\nan organization. The evidence collected draws on such sources as the company’s accounting systems and the underlying documentation, its tangible assets, and \\ninterviews with managers, employees, customers, suppliers, and other third parties \\nhaving some knowledge of the company.

How far should a company be expected to go? \\nLevels of reporting by companies vary widely, partly reflecting different accounting \\nregimes, partly different opinions on what it is appropriate to report, and partly on the different needs of report users. The information generated by such reports, and \\navailable from other sources, is used by analysts in risk-rating. They are interested, \\nfor example, in working out the appropriate levels of share pricing, premiums for insurance policies, or security for loans. Even today, environmental and social risks \\nare not high on the agenda for most companies, with the result that very few annual \\nreports yet contain a robust section on social and/or environmental performance. \\nAnother use for the reported data is benchmarking, which involves comparisons \\nof processes and products, both within an industry and outside it, to identify and \\nthen meet or exceed best practice.

Think of the early controversies around slavery, child labor, and working conditions. But, following a flurry of interest in social accounting and auditing in the \\n1970s, the environmental agenda has tended to attract greater attention. The result, \\nparadoxically, is that many business people these days feel happier being challenged on environmental issues than on social issues. This fact has had a marked impact on \\nthe way the sustainability agenda is defined by business. \\n \\nNatural Capital \\nHow can a would-be sustainable corporation work out whether it is environmentally \\nsustainable? Again, a critical first step is to understand what is meant by natural \\ncapital. The concept of natural wealth is both complex and still evolving. If you try to account for the natural capital embodied in a forest, for example, it is not simply a \\nquestion of counting the trees and trying to put a price-tag on the lumber they \\nrepresent. You have to account for the underlying natural wealth which supports the forest ecosystem, producing — as just one stream of benefits — timber and other \\ncommercial products. Wider forest functions that need to be added into the equation \\ninclude contributions to the regulation of water (in the atmosphere, water table, soils, and surface waters) and of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane.\\n9 And \\nthen there are all the flora and fauna, including commercial fisheries, whose health is \\nlinked to the health of the forest. \\nNatural capital can also be thought of as coming in two main forms: “critical \\nnatural capital” and renewable, replaceable, or substitutable natural capital. The first \\nform embraces natural capital which is essential to the maintenance of life and ecosystem integrity; the second forms of natural capital which can be renewed (e.g. \\nthrough breeding or relocation of sensitive ecosystems), repaired (e.g. environmental \\nremediation or desert reclamation), or substituted or replaced (e.g. growing use of man-made substitutes, such as solar panels in place of limited fossil fuels).\\n10 ', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 93}),\n",

What \\nforms of natural capital are affected by our current operations — and will they be \\naffected by our planned activities? Are these forms of natural capital sustainable \\ngiven these, and other, likely pressures? Is the overall level of stress properly understood and likely to be sustainable? Is the “balance of nature” or the “web of \\nlife” likely to be significantly affected? \\nThe interesting thing about a company’s ecological bottom line is that the \\ncarrying capacity of most ecosystems varies in relation to the number — and \\nbehavior — of the economic actors operating within them. As a result, these bottom \\nlines will vary over time and space. The more efficient the actors, however, the more actors can be sustained. This is the basis of the Factor 4/10 approach discussed in the \\nSpotlight (p. 78). \\n \\nAccountability \\nIn many countries, companies are hold are countable by regulators for aspects of \\ntheir environmental performance. In the USA, the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) \\nrequires companies producing more than certain threshold limits of over 600 chemicals to report their emissions. Some countries, like the Netherlands, also back \\nup their regulations with voluntary programs designed to push companies towards \\nsectorally agreed targets. \\nJust as often, however, business is held to account by environmentalist and \\nmedia campaigns, which may bear little relation to regulated or voluntarily agreed \\ntargets. And as companies begin to challenge their supply chains, a new dimension of pressure is being introduced. While planning this book, for example, I was invited \\nby Volvo to help facilitate their first environmental conference for supplier \\ncompanies. The company’s top management told the 500-plus audience that Volvo had started off by focusing on safety, then added quality.

Take the \\ncase of T&N, which as Turner & Newall was once one of the world’s largest \\nasbestos producers. For years, the company argued that the risks involved in the use of asbestos were acceptable. Eventually, however, the tide turned, not only against \\nTurner & Newall but against the entire asbestos industry. At the time of writing, \\nT&N had already paid out over £350 million over ten years to meet asbestos claims — and was busily selling off corporate assets to fund a further £323 million \\nprovision.\\n13 And, in an attempt to draw a line under its asbestos legacy, the company \\nhad announced a £515 million charge against a nnual profits to meet future personal \\ninjury claims and insurance costs. It was not alone in experiencing such problems. \\n \\nIssues and Indicators \\nThe sheer number of potential issues, and hence the expanding range of possible \\nenvironmental risks, is reflected in the potential indicators. These include financial \\nindicators such as: trends in legal compliance; provisions for fines, insurance, and \\nother legally related costs; and landscaping, remediation, decommissioning, and abandonment costs. But there is also a growing need to measure environmental \\nimpacts in terms of new metrics, including: the number of public complaints; the \\nlifecycle impacts of products; energy, materials, and water usage at production sites; potentially polluting emissions; environmental hazards, and risks; waste generation; \\nconsumption of critical natural capital; and performance against best-practice \\nstandards set by leading customers and by green and ethical investment funds. \\nAt the company level, the task is being made somewhat easier by the \\ndevelopment and publication of international environmental management standards. \\nGlobally, there is ISO 14001, developed by the International Standards Organisation (ISO) in the wake of the 1992 Earth Summit.\\n14 In Europe, there is the Eco-\\nManagement and Audit Scheme (EMAS), which takes a step beyond ISO 14001 by', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 95}),\n",

This is an area where national and international government agencies and research organizations will continue to play a critically important role. \\n \\nAuditing \\nThe purpose of audits is to assess the state of a company’s management systems and \\nits progress against a range of indicators and targets.

Indeed, \\nSustainAbility helped spur the trend with The Environmental Audit, a report \\npublished jointly with WWF in 1990.15 Such audits should focus on the \\nenvironmental impact of the audited organization, but most still focus on \\nmanagement systems rather than real-world environmental effects. So, for example, they review such areas as: compliance against regulations and other standards; the \\nperformance of internal management systems; trends in energy usage, waste \\nproduction, and recycling; and the use of eco-efficient technologies. \\n \\nReporting, Risk-rating, and Benchmarking \\nThe environmental reporting and benchmarking trends are enormously significant and are discussed in Chapter 7. The first few corporate environmental reports (CERs), or environmental annual reports (EARs), were published in 1990 — and \\ntheir number has subsequently mushroomed to many hundreds. Most of these \\nreports have been prepared on a voluntary basis, with the result that the indicators used and the presentation of performance data are highly diverse, complicating \\ncomparisons. Nor are most much help yet for those trying to assess the risks \\nassociated with the operations of given companies. \\nThese problem are, however, slowly being addressed as reporting companies \\nbegin to relate their performance against such indicators as the amount of emissions \\nor waste produced per unit of either volume or value of production.

But this is an area where environmentalists and huma n \\nrights campaigners, traditionally two separate communities, have been finding \\ncommon cause. To begin with, the focus was on the question of whether certai n \\ngroups of deprived Americans were also selectively disadvantaged through \\nexposure to environmental problems. Many companies fought the environmental \\njustice lobby, but subsequent research found that economically and sociall y \\ndeprived groups are also more likely to be environmentally disadvantaged. \\n“On average, 230 times more toxic waste was emitted in neighbourhoods \\nnear the plants of the fifty largest industrial toxic polluters than in the communities of the CEOs  responsible for the waste,” noted Steven Viederman o\\nf \\nthe US  Jessie Smith Noyes Foundation.16 The agenda is now expanding to \\nembrace such issues as the rights of the Ogoni people of Nigeria or the global worming-related threats to the livelihoods of people in countries like \\nBangladesh.\\n17 \\nAnd the evidence suggests that the tide can be reversed.

In part, it comprises human capital, in the form of public health, skills and \\neducation. But it also must embrace wider measures of a society’s health and wealth-\\ncreation potential. \\nOne of the key recent books to address this area was Making Democracy Work, \\nby Robert D. Putnam.19 The book focuses on Italy and considers what makes some \\ndemocratic governments succeed — and some fail. But the book which really switched me on to the notion of social capital was Francis Fukuyama’s Trust: The \\nSocial Virtues and the Creation of Prosperity.\\n20 Fukuyama says that social capital is \\n“a capability that arises from the prevalence of trust in a society or in certain parts of it.” It is a measure of “the ability of people to work together for common purposes in \\ngroups and organizations.” This ability is likely to be critical to the sustainability \\ntransition. It can be developed (or eroded) at every level in a society, from the basic family unit to the major institutions of international government. It depends on the \\nacquisition and maintenance of such virtues as loyalty, honesty and dependability. \\nThe central benefits flow from a lowering of social friction. So, for example, \\nFukuyama notes that: \\n \\n“if people who have to work together in an enterprise trust one another \\nbecause they are all operating according to a common set of ethical norms, \\ndoing business costs less. Such a society will be better able to innovate \\norganizationally, since the high degree of trust will permit a wide variety of social relationships to emerge.” \\n \\nIn the same way, the degree of trust between a corporation or industry and their \\nexternal stakeholders is likely to be a key factor determining their long-term \\nsustainability. Conversely, “widespread distrust in a society imposes a kind of tax on \\nall forms of economic activity, a tax that high-trust societies do not have to pay.” \\nA key assumption in the work SustainAbility has done in recent years is that \\nsustainable development is most — likely and will be achieved at the lowest overall \\ncost to the economy — in those societies where there are the highest levels of trust and other forms of social capital. This, in turn, is likely to depend on the levels and \\nequity of investment in human capital. According to Ismail Serageldin, the World \\nBank’s vice president of environmentally sustainable development, human capital requires “investments in education, health and nutrition.” Developing and spreading \\nthe necessary skills and training, particularly in the emerging economies and \\ndeveloping countries, will require new forms of public-private partnership.

Governments try to regulate and otherwise control the social impacts associated with industry and commerce, but history is full of examples where the agenda was created outside the \\nintertwined worlds of government and business.

But, faced with massed rallies by tens of thousands of \\nRuhr steelworkers concerned about the implications for their jobs and protesting \\nabout “casino capitalism” and calling for “people before profit,” Krupp — and its partner banks, Deutsche, Dresdner, and Goldman Sachs — backed down.\\n21 The \\ndecision was widely hailed by German politicians as evidence that the country’s \\nsocial consensus economy works; that “social responsibility” had prevailed.

To begin with, the focus was on consumers and those directly affected \\nby a company’s products, but the new, more inclusive models of stakeholder \\ncapitalism have progressively drawn the boundaries so as to include an ever-widening range of stakeholders. The social statement produced by the Body Shop as \\npart of its 1995 Values Report (Case Study, p. 139), and verified by the New \\nEconomics Foundation (NEF), provides a striking illustration of the trend. \\nOne of the more interesting conferences on the whole area of social and ethical \\naccounting, auditing and reporting happened in 1996 at, of all places, Windsor \\nCastle.\\n24 The proceedings of the event, funded by the Environment Foundation, \\norganized by NEF, and drawing together practitioners from as far apart as Canada, \\nDenmark, India and the USA, were subsequently published by a new organization, \\nthe Institute of Social and Ethical AccountAbility (ISEA), which is dedicated to developing and promoting this dimension of the emerging corporate agenda.\\n25 \\nThis is the wave of the future, but this area, inevitably, will also prove to have its \\nown ethical dilemmas. In summing up the conference, Simon Zadek of NEF, a devoted proponent of social auditing, noted: \\n \\n“At the turn of the century, the dominant management systems were the so-\\ncalled Taylorian systems — ways of controlling our bodies to maximise \\nefficiency, productivity, and profit. As we moved into the 60s and 70s, we \\nbegan thinking about flexible management systems, which used the imagination and flexibility of people’s minds to further increase productivity \\nand business success. Today, we have social auditing.” \\n \\n“There is a real possibility,” he warned, “that it might be used as a way of \\ncontrolling people’s hearts and souls.” \\n \\nAccounting \\nSocial accounting aims to assess the impact of an organization or company on \\npeople both inside and outside.

At a time when the traditional relationships \\nbetween companies and their employees are changing fundamentally, with eve n \\nthe largest companies moving sharply away from lifetime employment, the \\nwhole issue of trust is also becoming increasingly charged. The result is tha t \\nindividual agenda items, like business ethics, contain greater potential energy — and, if mismanaged, destructive power — than in the post. \\nEthical behavior, whether of an individual, organization, or corporation, is \\njudged to be good, just, and honorable. Much business behavior causes offence \\nbecause it is unethical, but in some cases —because ethics can vary from perso n \\nto person, from company to company, and from culture to culture — the proble m \\nis that different ethical principles are being applied inside and outside the company. Some ethical violations are also legal violations, as when there is \\nfraud or corruption. But many are not. For example, a company may sometimes \\nlegally stretch the truth when making claims about its products or provide customers with less than full value. \\nThe emerging field of ethical — or socially responsible — investmen\\nt \\nfocuses not only on a company’s behavior but also on the industry it is in and the markets it serves. So, for example, products such as tobacco and armaments \\n(particularly when indiscriminate in their action as is potentially the case with \\nmines or germ warfare weapons) are often considered unethical and companies making them are usually screened out of investment portfolios. \\nThe triple bottom line itself potentially raises a range of ethical issues. How, \\nfor example, should economic, social and environmental priorities be assessed and, more importantly, traded off? A company may successfully make pollutio\\nn \\ncontrol technology, yet sell its products in countries which — like Burma — are \\nconsidered out of bounds on ethical grounds.

A key area of activity in this respect will be “full cost pricing” — underpinned by new forms of full cost accounting. The idea of full \\ncost pricing is that all the costs associated with a product or service should be \\ninternalized, and, as a result, reflected in its price.

As an example of ongoing work, the social indicator movement has been trying to work out ways of measuring wealth creation and individual well-\\nbeing more accurately than when conventional measures like gross national \\nproduct (GNP) are used. \\nUntil very recently, economists and business people alike thought of “qualit y \\nof life” and “standard of living” as identical.

In the UK, too, the perceived \\nquality of life deteriorated substantially between 1975 and 1990 — according to the country’s first index of “real” social wealth — even though money incomes \\nhad continued to rise. According to the New Economics Foundation (NEF), \\ndespite a 230% increase in GNP over the period and a near-doubling i\\nn \\nconsumer spending, the costs of commuting, pollution, policing, and cumulative \\nenvironmental damage all rose significantly. \\nEmerging indicators include the Human Development Indicator (HDI) and \\nthe Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW). The latter adjusts normal \\nmeasures of welfare by subtracting, for example, the costs of unemployment, \\ncommuting, automobile accidents, and all forms of environmental pollution.

It is one thing to suggest, as some do, that a sustainable corporation is one which “leaves the biosphere no worse off at \\nthe end of the accounting period than it was at the beginning,” but when we include \\nthe social and ethical dimensions of sustainability the range of sustainability-related issues and impacts grows dramatically.

Intel faced a \\nterrible choice in the mid-1980s. Having invented dynamic random access memory, better known as DRAM, Intel was forced to watch as lower-cost Japanese producers \\ntook over the DRAM market. What should Intel do? Intel did the unthinkable, \\nwalking away from the memory business. Instead, the company focused on microprocessors and, in the space of a few short years, became much more \\nprosperous as the world’s largest microchip producer. \\nAs a result of such experiences, Grove now keeps an eye out of for what he calls \\n“strategic inflection points,” which he described as “times in the life of a business \\nwhen its fundamentals are about to change,” and for “10x” changes — moments \\nwhen the forces affecting a given company suddenly multiply ten-fold. But how can a company recognize one of these 10x market transformations in advance? It’s \\ndifficult. Even Grove cannot provide infallible clues on how to spot strategic \\ninflection points in advance. But his description of how such shifts can transform markets is worth repeating. \\n“Strategic inflection points can be caused by technological change, but they are \\nmore than technological change,” he notes: \\n \\n“They can be caused by competitors but they are more than just competition. \\nThey are full-scale changes in the way business is conducted, so that simply adopting a new technology or fighting the competition as you used to may be \\ninsufficient. They build up force so insidiously that you may have a hard time \\neven putting a finger on what has changed, yet you know something has.” ', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 116}),\n",

This may seem paradoxical, given the success of the IT industry’s amazing \\npursuit of the Moore’s Law curve, which means that it continuously creates greater value out of ever-shrinking inputs (at least per unit of product) of energy, materials, \\nand other environmentally significant resources. But as we will see, Intel — like all \\nother industries, many of which are its customers — now faces another 10x change in the form of the Factor 4—Factor 10 objectives of eco-efficiency. Potentially, this \\nwill be another huge opportunity for Intel, where Factor 4 change probably seems \\ntame, but not for all of the company’s current customers. Grove himself notes, “You can be the subject of a strategic inflection point but you can also be the cause of \\none.” So will Intel commit to becoming a catalyst for future sustainability inflection \\npoints? \\nWhy Worry? \\nGoodbye to Predictability \\nFor those who are uncomfortable with change, there are plenty of reasons to worry. \\nThe number of 10x changes can only grow.

It has been a precondition for the fourteen-fold expansion in \\nworld trade in goods since 1950 and a six-fold increase in world production. As closed trade ushered in depression and war in the 1930s, open trade has paved the \\nway for continued post-war growth and prosperity.” As a result, the OECD is \\ncommitted to helping the World Trade Organization (WTO) push forward with trade liberalization. \\nSome environmentalists recognize that this trend could bring benefits in terms of \\nglobal development, efficiency, and innovation, but most remain profoundly skeptical.

New-style \\nenvironmentalists, among them the CEOs of a growing number of leading \\ncompanies, may see business and markets as the way forward — but many are \\nuncomfortably aware that the results will be less predictable than when the agenda was mainly driven by governments. \\nAs liberalization proceeds, organizations like the WTO and OECD are hard-\\nselling the values and principles of markets and competition around the world. They are also working to remove or reduce anti-competitive practices, public or private, \\nthat threaten to impede the openness of markets to international competition.\\n4 \\nUnfortunately, some of these practices are rules, standards, and regulations put in place with the explicit aim of protecting both people (in such areas as labor \\nstandards and human rights) and the natural environment. \\nMany business people, it has to be said, welcome this process.

When you burn them you incinerate your business.” \\n \\nNo one disputes the need for companies to be leaner and meaner when the \\nmarket requires it, nor — in competitive markets — to make “assets sweat.” But the \\nchances are that we will begin to see more business leaders putting down their axes \\nand reflecting on what their companies are for — and where they are headed. Not that further slimming is out of the question. Indeed, we will see more and more \\ncompanies adopting “lean thinking,” a more complex, sophisticated approach and \\nthe title of a book by James P. Womack and Daniel T. Jones.\\n8 The key to this \\nstrategy is the elimination of all forms of waste. The idea is that each business needs \\nto map its “value streams” and build new types of relationship with customers such \\nthat products are pulled through the value chain by customer demand, not pushed by producers. \\nThe result, a seditious thought, is that, as the  Financial Times put it, only what is \\nneeded will actually be made.” Indirectly, this is clearly an approach that could help companies drive towards their eco-efficiency goals. In setting out the case for \\ncompanies to look well beyond their operations, with a view to transforming the \\nvalue stream, Womack and Jones also blaze the trail for those committed to persuading more companies to adopt a life-cycle approach to their products and \\nactivities. Unfortunately, as they are quick to admit, not even Toyota, a long-time \\npioneer in lean production, has yet gone as far as they would like. But one thing is certain. Companies that are better at managing the flow of value through their \\nbusinesses will generally be more eco-efficient. \\n \\nApproaching “Absolute Zero” \\nMore worrying is Market Unbound, by senior McKinsey consultants Lowell Bryan \\nand Diana Farrell.9 They describe the accelerating shift of power from national \\neconomic and political elites to global elites — and to the global capital market. “Like an awkward adolescent,” they report: ', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 120}),\n",

The first of these is the assessment of “sustainable competitive advantage.” The second is the emerging concept of “business \\necosystems,” with competition taking place not just at the level of the individual \\ncompany but also at the level of constellations of linked companies. And the third is the dematerialization agenda advanced by the Factor 10 Club (see Spotlight, p. 78). \\n \\nWaking up the Chairman \\nIn most companies, the environmental agenda has been handled by environmental \\nprofessionals, rather than by the board. Now, as argued in Chapter 10, the corporate \\ngovernance dimensions of the sustainability agenda need urgent attention. So how \\ncan we get boards to wake up in time? One answer is to publish surveys ranking companies in terms of their understanding of, and, increasingly, performance \\nagainst, the triple bottom line. Let’s look at two recent survey reports, one by \\nMorgan Stanley, the US investment bank, the other by the UK green business organization, Business in the Environment. \\nThe Morgan Stanley analysts were asked to identify companies worldwide \\nenjoying what was called a “sustainable competitive advantage.”\\n15 Again, their \\ndefinition of “sustainable” was much narrower than would be required for a full \\ntriple bottom line analysis. Their aim was to produce a map of global \\ncompetitiveness. Some of the results came as no great surprise. The US advantage is overwhelming, for example, with 125 American companies among the 238 world \\nleaders identified. More surprisingly, the UK came second, with 21, ahead of Japan \\nwith 19, and Germany with 10. Among the UK-based companies flagged up as highly competitive are GlaxoWellcome, British Airways, Unilever, Reuters and \\nRTZ. A perhaps less obvious leader was Spirax Sarco, an engineering company \\nwhich controls 30% of the global steam controls market. According to Morgan Stanley, Spirax Sarco’s competitive advantage is likely to be “sustainable,” a key \\naspect of the study, for 10–20 years, since it would take that long for a competitor to \\novertake it. \\nOf course, ill sorts of things can go wrong along the way.

But the underlying point was clear: Japan, \\nwhich had dominated the 1980s with new techniques such as kaizen and just-in-time \\nmanagement, was now seeing a range of international competitors gaining a new head of steam having made major technological and structural changes. \\nAs a means of describing the competitive performance of whole economies, the \\nFinancial Times argued, the Morgan Stanley approach is “rough and ready.” Its \\nmain advantage, on the other hand, is that it approaches the issue of competitiveness \\nfrom “an unfamiliar angle.” And the same can be said for the Business in the \\nEnvironment (BiE) Index of Corporate Environmental Engagement,\\n16 described in \\nChapter 11. \\nThe BiE survey focused on the Financial Times Stock Exchange (FT-SE) 100 \\ncompanies. The goal was to wake up company boards to the emerging challenge. The stratagem worked. The phones rang off the hook in the three organizations that \\nproduced the survey. Many calls were from environmental specialists in companies \\nwhere the chairman, CEO, or other board members had woken up to find themselves publicly listed as less than perfect in some aspect of their environmental \\nengagement.

Whereas traditional competition has focused on products and \\nmarkets, with one company’s products competing head-on with another’s, the new \\napproach sees business ecosystems developing very much like biological ecosystems. As they do so, they move through similar stages: pioneering, expansion, \\nauthority, and renewal. \\nThe focus now is not just on a given company, but on its entire environment. \\n“Companies need to coevolve with others in the environment,” Moore explains, “a \\nprocess that involves cooperation as well as conflict.

As a result, we are seeing companies finding \\nthemselves competing with unlikely rivals. “The most creative and aggressive \\ncompanies exploit these wider territories,” Moore observes, “transforming the landscape with new ecosystems. The dominant new ecosystems will likely cross \\nseveral different industries, and they will joust with similar networks spread across \\nstill other industries.” For the moment, it is sufficient to say that the real test for 21st century businesses will be to outperform their rivals at creating the new business \\necosystems needed to build and sustain their triple bottom line performance. \\n \\nThe Ultimate 10x Challenge \\nWhen the history of the late 20th century is written, the first meeting in October \\n1994 of the Factor 10 Club could rank alongside the early meetings of the \\nBolsheviks or the early garage days of Apple Computer as one of the century’s formative moments.

Given that western societies typically \\nconsume 20 to 30 times more than their counterparts in the less developed world, the \\nCarnoules Declaration calls for Factor 10 improvements (i.e. 90% reductions). \\nInevitably, this trend will proceed at different speeds in different world regions. \\nBut over a time-scale of decades it is as likely to be driven by price increases and tax \\nreforms as by changing values — the subject of Chapter 6.

Salomon Inc CEO \\nRobert Denham noted: \\n \\n“Environmental issues are very important to a lot of the industries we’re \\ninvolved with, and if we can have a better understanding of those issues and \\ndeliver better advisory services in transactions or acquisitions, then that’s \\nanother factor to distinguish us from our competitors.” \\n \\nWith brains like these trying to spot winners and losers, the chances are that the \\nnatural selection pressures on industry are about to go up several notches. And when it comes to where future growth, sustainable or unsustainable, will most likely \\nhappen, Jim Rogers is a man worth listening to. In the 1970s, he was the other half \\nof the team that helped George Soros start up as a fund manager: Soros traded, Rogers did the research. Between 1969, when they set up, and 1980 they managed a \\ngain of 3,365 per cent, while the US market — as measured by the Standard & Poors \\ncomposite index — rose just 47 points. In the end, having made his fortune, Rogers bailed out and traveled around the world by motorbike. \\nIn his book, Investment Biker,\\n22 Rogers thought he could discern the outlines of \\none major future economic growth area. “When you stand back and look at Asia,” he explained: \\n \\n“a few facts leap out.

No, he argued. “On my motorcycle ride through Siberia, I saw \\nChinese workers operating Russian enterprises in Khabarovsk and Blagoveshchensk with the benefit of Japanese capital and management. This golden triangle will be \\nthe most productive and prosperous arrangement on the planet throughout the 21st \\ncentury.” It will also, consequently, be a place to watch for major ecological disasters. \\nSuch development will help skew the business agenda towards new issues. Some \\nkey triple bottom line objectives will clearly not be achieved as fast as most campaigners would like; indeed, we may sometimes see progress going into reverse. \\nTake child labor. Despite the fact that the International Labour Organization (ILO) is \\ndedicated to abolishing child labor worldwide, it reports that a quarter of children tinder the age of 15 are employed in parts of Ghana, India, Indonesia, and Senegal. \\nTheir work is often considered essential to maintaining the financial health of the \\nfamily. Given these facts, it seems likely that companies trading with such countries will continue to find themselves — as Nike and Reebok have been — attacked by \\nvalues-led campaigners. \\nSome relatively advanced countries will also try to attract inward investment by \\nexplicitly holding down social standards, as Britain did in refusing to implement the \\nEuropean Union’s “Social Chapter.” Sometimes this will work: certainly Britain has \\nattracted a high proportion of incoming investment.

But, as the transition takes hold, few companies or \\nsectors will escape strategic inflections driven by regulators, market-makers \\n(i.e. those who shape market expectations and priorities), and competitors in pursuit of radically improved performance against the triple bottom line. \\n♦ Third, business leaders determined to ride out the waves of change need to \\nbe focusing today on “lean thinking,” Factor 4/10 dematerialization and the opportunities that will be created by the sustainability transition.

One such company is the Swedish auto-maker Volvo. And the late \\nBeatle came to mind as I flew to Gothenburg to help with the launch event fo\\nr \\nVolvo’s new environmental supplier challenge — because the company was beginning to rattle its supply chain with rare enthusiasm. \\nVolvo’s then CEO, Sören Gyll, told the assembled suppliers that this was jus\\nt \\nthe beginning of a multi-year, global campaign. Hundreds of suppliers had bee n \\ninvited to hear about the new campaign, designed to ensure that environmental \\ncare is given equal priority alongside two long-established core values; safet y \\nand quality. Now Volvo planned to add a third performance dimension; environment. The company announced that it would begin to include \\nenvironmental factors in its audits of suppliers. “The race has started,” said Han-\\nOlov Olsson, Vice President responsible for marketing at Volvo Ca\\nr \\nCorporation. \\nSome years ago, the company even invited its customers to think whethe r \\nthey needed to take their cars when traveling into city centers. Better, its CEO noted, to take public transport. Volvo, as it happens, also makes buses! But we \\nstill seem light years away from the day when auto companies happily invite \\ncustomers to complete some form of Need Test (see Chapter 8) before suggesting that they buy — or lease — a car.

In the process, they will do as they think best. “If you want them to do as the company thinks best too,” Tom Stewart warned senior executives in Fortune, \\n“then  you must hope that they have an inner gyroscope aligned with the corporate \\ncompass.”\\n3 \\nThese inner gyroscopes and corporate compasses are rooted in values. Stewart \\ndistinguished “hard” corporate values (e.g. profitability) from “soft” values (e.g. \\nintegrity, respect for employees, and sustainability). Where employee surveys have been carried out by companies aspiring to embrace both types of value, most people \\nthink their organization takes the hard values seriously — but the proportion \\nbelieving that it respects the softer values turns out to be very much lower. \\nShifts in our values often take place over extended time-scales, but attitudinal \\nresearch suggests that this process is well under way in relation to the values \\nnecessary to drive and support the sustainability transition. The sorts of areas where campaigners have been focusing their efforts were well illustrated by a 1991 book, \\nChanging Corporate Values ,\\n4 produced by New Consumer.

For one thing, there \\nwas a long-standing aversion in Japan to talking frankly and in public about the \\nAIDS problem. Even a decade after the problem was first recognized, some Japanese \\ndoctors were still not informing patients when they tested positive for the DIV virus, while some hospitals simply turned HIV patients away. But there were also deep-\\nrooted weaknesses in the country’s regulatory system. Many blood products \\ncompanies employ retired health ministry bureaucrats, as part of a process called amakudari, or “descent from heaven.” In short, those still working in government \\nwere too close to those they were supposed to be regulating. \\nGreen Cross, which expected its liabilities to run into hundreds of millions of \\ndollars, was subsequently accused by the health ministry of having dumped infected \\nstock on the market to clear its inventory. It was also accused of having falsified \\ndocuments to show that it had stopped selling contaminated products before it actually did so. Although the company denied the charges, the controversy was \\nmoving too quickly. Victims sued Green Cross, the country’s leading blood products \\nsupplier, along with two other Japanese companies and the local units of Germany’s Bayer and of Baxter. Before long, Japanese TV viewers saw an unusual spectacle. \\nTop executives of Green Cross knelt before a group of victims and family members, \\npressing their heads to the floor and mumbling apologies for ten minutes. \\nAlthough the company’s admission of guilt may help it in Japan, where criminal \\nsentences are often lighter for those who have expressed remorse, there was a \\ndownside: all five companies would be even more exposed to possible criminal charges in Japan, and the foreign companies could face civil suits in the USA and \\nEurope. \\nBut the whole saga can be seen in a different light if you know that Green Cross \\nfounder Ryoichi Naito was himself a war criminal. He had been a doctor at the \\ninfamous Unit 731, an Imperial Army germwarfare group that conducted terrible \\nexperiments on prisoners of war during World War II. Under Naito, who died in 1982, just before the AIDS issue really hit, Green Cross pursued an aggressive \\nbusiness strategy, which he once summed up in the terrifying words: “Money is \\nmore important than blood.” \\nThe Green Cross example raises questions about whether corrupt companies are \\nborn corrupt or have corruption thrust upon them.

One notable exception is Levi Strauss, best known for its \\n501 jeans. With 1995 profits of $700 million on a turnover of $6.7 billion, the company was way ahead of its competitors, The interesting question is, did the \\ncompany’s ability to focus on values flow from its profitability, or vice versa? \\nThe company has long roots — starting back in the 1850s, when the original \\nMr Strauss began selling early versions of Levis to San Francisco’s gold-rush \\nminers — but only began to work on the ethical side of its business in recen\\nt \\ndecades. The real progress dates from 1974, when Bob Haas, a compan y \\nemployee since 1973 and a member of the founding family, took over as chie f \\nexecutive. Within twelve months, he had carried out a highly leveraged \\nmanagement buy-out of the 63% of the firm’s equity in public hands, ending Levi’s 14 years as a listed company. Haas was motivated by a concern that an\\ny \\ncompany with a public listing suffers because the demands of shareholders, \\nanalysts, and other financial outsiders can seriously impair corporate vision. \\nUnusually, Haas also looked for ways in which he and the Haas family could \\nshare the company’s profitability more broadly with employees. In Haas’s ow n \\nwords, the resulting Global Success Sharing Plan (GSSP) come about for both philosophical and commercial reasons: \\n \\n“Throughout our history, we have sought to conduct our business in ways \\nthat are consistent with our values, which include recognition — both \\npsychic and financial — for those who contribute to our success. This \\nplan is particularly faithful to our values because everyone will work towards a shared objective in order to receive individual rewards.” \\n \\nThe company’s ethics code defines commercial achievements as “broade r \\nthan merely financial success.” Like many other companies, as Managemen t \\nToday  put it, “Levi’s also publishes a paper mountain of aspiration statements, \\nethical guidelines, codes of conduct — you name it, they most certainly have it.” But they live up to the pledges. So, for example, Levi’s is phasing out all its \\noperations in China, including marketing and distribution, because of tha\\nt \\ncountry’s human rights record.

The difference is that much \\nmore of the pressure on human rights and other ethical issues is now likely to be directed at major international companies rather than governments. And the problem \\nhere is clear. As Nike chief executive Philip Knight put it, “We’re dealing with \\ngovernments that are less than ideal.” An interesting example of how a company can deal effectively with this new agenda is provided by Levi Strauss (see Case Study, p. \\n134). The upside, it hopes, is that motivated employees will help drive innovatio n \\nand continuously renew competitive advantage. If the GSSP targets are met, the 2001 payout to employees will be equivalent to about a year’s profits at curren\\nt \\nlevels. Given that some 94% of the company’s stock is owned by descendants o f \\nthe original founder, with the lion’s share in the hands of Bob Haas and his uncle, Peter Haas Snr., the company has had a much easier ride of it than would \\nhave been the case if it had to contend with dividend-hungry institutional \\ninvestors. \\nLevi’s is also strongly committed to diversity, with the idea that the \\nworkforce in every country where the company operates should reflect the local \\nethnic and social mix. Recruitment policies are tailored to this end and job ads are placed in magazines that are known to reach minorities like black and \\ndisabled people. \\nAmong many other initiatives, the company’s Global Sourcing Guidelines \\nare designed to ensure that it does not buy products from sweatshops using — \\nand often abusing — child labor But Levi’s has been sensitive in the way it has \\nimplemented the policy. According to one consultant who has worked with the company, examples include Bangladesh and Turkey, “where children were \\nworking for contractors, providing their family’s only source of income. Levi’s \\npaid the contractors to keep them in school until they were 14; it costs the m \\nmore, but it’s a long-term view.” \\nSo, does Levi’s ethical stance help motivate employees and sell more jeans? \\nThe answer appears to be that it does. But the company also appears to be the corporate equivalent of a Rorshach Test: what you see in Levi’s very much \\ndepends on your own priorities and ethics. Some see a privately-held compan\\ny \\nwith an attitude which would not be ethical if applied to a listed company — where the main goal is to maximize owner value. Others see the company as a\\nn \\nearly experiment in business ethics which will soon spread to many othe r \\ncompanies, sectors, and countries.

When López quit GM to become a top executive at VW, it was alleged that he had also taken with him top secrets covering such areas as supplier price lists, future \\nGM products, and plans for a new experimental factory. GM not only wanted an \\napology from top VW management; it was also seeking damages running into hundreds of millions of dollars, perhaps even billions. \\nThe case spotlighted the growing importance of information about the economic \\naspects of the entire life-cycle of the auto industry — and of other sectors (see Chapter 8).

Now that we see “world competition between rival cultures of capitalism,” it is more \\nimportant than ever to understand these differences if we are to catalyze and direct \\nthe sustainability transition.

These cultural preferences, or values, are the bedrock of national \\nidentity and the source of economic strengths — and weaknesses.” \\n \\nThe failure of so many economists to properly understand wealth creation, \\nHampden-Turner and Trompenaars argue, flows from the fact that they have studied how people use money, not why they do this or what their motives may be. \\n“Economics,” they conclude: \\n \\n“is so concerned with counting and itemizing that it has lost sight of the one \\ncomponent, almost unmeasurable, that makes all economic activity possible: \\nhuman relationships. Behind every economic transaction are people making choices, acting on their values, giving one thing high priority, another one \\nlow.” \\n \\nEach of the seven nations evaluated turns out to have its own unique \\ncombination of values. “This value set is an economic fingerprint,” Hampden-Turner \\nand Trompenaars argue, which “correlates with specific types of economic achievement and failure.” In a world aspiring to achieve sustainable development, an \\nin-depth understanding of these differences — and of the best ways of managing \\nthem — is clearly going to be essential.

It will \\ntransform human values, political visions and the societal “rules of the game” from: \\n \\n“economic efficiency towards social equity, from individual rights to \\ncollective obligations, from selfishness to community, from quantity to \\nquality, from separation to interdependence, from exclusion to equality of opportunity, from men to women, from luxury to n ecessity, from repression to \\nfreedom, from today to tomorrow, and from growth that benefits a few to \\ngenuine human development that benefits us all.” \\n \\nChallenge to the World \\nBut the problem that international companies can trip over is that even if different \\ncultures decide to pursue sustainability, they are very likely to define and pursue it in different ways. So what chance is there of developing a global consensus on \\nbusiness ethics? The answer is that although globalization and information \\ntechnology seem to be driving us in this direction, the transition is likely to prove a very tough challenge. Even if we eventually achieve elements of a global consensus, \\nit will take decades, even generations, and the risks for companies straddling \\ndifferent cultures look set to grow rather than shrink. \\nOne thinker who has been trying to sketch out elements of a global ethic is the \\nSwiss theologian Hans Küng, director of the Global Ethic Foundation, based in \\nTübingen, Germany. He argues that the need for consensus has become critical in the wake of the rapid changes in technology, science, and global trade.\\n20 “Business \\nmust have its place, must be efficient, must make a profit,” he argues. “But an \\ninterest only in business, as an interest only in oneself, is dangerous. The economy is \\nnot an end in itself: it is there to serve human needs.”21 \\nOn globalization, Küng notes that it is an “ambiguous process.” He accepts that \\nit is inevitable, but argues that: \\n \\n“it has limits and it can be controlled. Since we have globalisation of capital, \\nwe must seek to globalise the ethical principles which are above it, A struggle for profit is ethically legitimate only if higher values prevail.” ', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 156}),\n",

Ethics is a challenge to the \\nworld.” In the past, religions have attempted to codify ethics, but have all-too-often \\nended up inspiring intolerance, hatred, cruelty, and war. Now, as we move into the \\n21st century, “pure capitalism endangers the basic social contract and will inevitably provoke a backlash.” \\nAs a result, Küng believes, there is a growing need for a basic minimum ethic, to \\nguide international politics and trade. And what would it involve? According to Küng, “A global ethic means a fundamental consensus on binding values, \\nirrevocable standards and personal attitudes which can be shared by people of all \\nreligions and also by nonbelievers.” Unfortunately, the major religions have found it impossible to reach consensus on specific ethical issues, including contraception, \\nabortion, and euthanasia. But, Küng insists, “the great religious traditions agree on \\nmost basic principles, as they have been formulated for the first time with the Declaration Toward a Global Ethic.” Adopted by the Parliament of the World’s \\nReligions in Chicago in 1993, the Declaration enshrines two fundamental demand: \\n“Every human being must be treated humanely. And what you do not wish done to yourself, do not do to others, which is known as the golden rule in most religions.” \\nWhether, like Tom Gladwin, we call these “rules of the game” or, like Hans \\nKüng, “golden rules,” it is increasingly clear that sustainable capitalism will depend on a shared understanding not only of the importance of values but also of the \\nadoption of specific principles. A tall order indeed, even if all politicians and \\nbusiness leaders were aware of the problems and committed to tackling them. So how much of this challenge is visible to those on the bridge of these great corporate \\nsupertankers as they surge forward into the third millennium? \\nBoardroom Views \\nShell-shocked \\n1995 shocked Shell rigid: first the Brent Spar controversy, then Nigeria. Top \\nmanagers were forced into a rapid rethink. “The fact that parts of Shell have been in \\nbusiness for 100 years is no guarantee that the future will be OK too,” warned Cor \\nHerkströter, chairman of the company’s committee of managing directors. At first, Shell thought in terms of persuading society that the company’s values and \\noperating principles were sound. But the scale of the reaction ultimately convinced \\ntop management that this was not going to be enough.

My own view was that there was no mystery about these reactions. \\nWorking with Dow Europe, SustainAbility had already identified deep-seated trends which seemed to indicate a fundamental shift in society’s values. The first trend was \\na decline in the legitimacy of governments and other political institutions; the \\nsecond was a growing tendency for product life-cycles to become more transparent to outside scrutiny, an issue to which we will return in Chapter 8; and the third we \\nsummed up in the phrase “ values shift ”. \\nWhen the events of 1995 began to unfold, it appeared increasingly obvious that \\nShell was going to be the first major casualty of all three trends. The giant oil \\ncompany had itself begun to detect warning signs in 1994 — but failed to react in \\ntime. Market research carried out on the Shell brand during the development of the company’s new retail visual identity revealed that among significant sections of the \\nWest European population, and particularly among the yo ung, Shell was seen as \\nbeing (to use the company’s own words) “somewhat old-fashioned and out of touch.” \\nAfter the shocks of 1995, Shell launched a series of roundtable meetings, taking \\nin 14 locations in Europe, the USA, the Middle East, the Asia-Pacific region, Australasia, Africa, and Latin America. The meetings, in places as different as Oslo \\nand Seoul, each brought together around a dozen Shell staff face-to-face with senior \\nfigures from business, NGOs, the media, academe, and government for a “full and frank exchange of views.” \\nWhat really marked out this “Society’s Changing Expectations” initiative was \\nthat Shell was being dramatically more open than in the past. “This initiative could probably have been carried out in confidence,” allowed Herkströter: \\n \\n“but to have done so would have struck at the heart of what it is about. We \\nwork in society’ around the world. Can we hope to su ccessfully touch base \\nwith that society if we do something like this, and then try to keep it quiet?” \\n \\nTo succeed. stakeholder engagement initiatives must be genuinely interactive. “I \\nfirmly believe that you do not only extract value, because then the process does not \\nreally work,” Herkströter explained. “You have to make absolutely certain that if you involve others, particularly third parties, you give value as well.” ', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 158}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Values 145 \\nNot a New Challenge \\nIn the wake of the Brent Spar controversy, I had found myself drawn into the debate. \\nAs the signatory of a letter to The Times ,22 I had positioned SustainAbility alongside \\nthose who argued that Shell’s decision on the Brent Spar had been wrong, but for \\nnew reasons. Before long, I had a number of opportunities to observe Shell’s reactions to the new values-based agenda at close quarters. \\nWith a group of colleagues from organizations like the New Economics \\nFoundation and Traidcraft, I helped Shell UK think through the issues around social accounting, auditing, and reporting. Separately, I took part in a session during which \\nShell UK’s managing director, Chris Fay, exposed his senior management team to \\nexternal challenge. One of my own questions to Chris Fay focused on the extent to which Shell could see the values shift taking place among the company’s own \\nyounger employees And, on a third occasion, Paul Hawken, Geoff Lye, and I spent \\ntwo days with senior Shell International people working through what the company should be doing in response to the new challenges. \\nBut, to my mind, by far the most interesting Shell perspective came from Car \\nHerkströter, musing on the lessons learned from 1995.\\n23 The problems Shell was \\nfacing, he stressed, were not as new as some critics might assume. In earlier \\ncenturies, Dutch multinational companies — among them the Compagnie van Verre, \\nthe Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie and the Nederlandsche Handel Maatschappij — also faced the challenge of operating in different cultures. \\n“Managers back then struggled with clashing value systems, conflicting moral \\nstandards and rapid technical change,” Herkströter recalled, “along with their primary responsibility of producing a good product and a decent profit!” \\nThe 20th century, he noted, had been “particularly bloody.” Catastrophes, \\ndisruptions, and wars had repeatedly tested Shell’s management. “In the process,” he said, “we have always bad to face up to many dilemmas — to the questions of where \\nto invest, how to balance differing demands and how to meet contradictory \\nexpectations.” But the late 1990s saw a new set of challenges. “The vast majority of us are living in relative peace and prosperity,” he continued: \\n \\n“yet, for reasons that we find difficult to identify, the institutions with which \\nwe grew up no longer appear to be as strong and healthy as they once were. \\nWhy are they not operating in the ways we have come to expect? Why are we \\ncoming up against problems that, with the best will in the world, we cannot seem to assess correctly?” ', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 159}),\n",

Shell had gone through a three year \\nprocess to identify the “best practical environmental option” for disposing of the \\nstructure. Deep sea disposal emerged as the best option, satisfying all the appropriate regulations and being approved by the UK Government. “But,” as Herkströter put it: \\n \\n“we found that what appeared to be the best option in the UK was not \\nacceptable elsewhere. We were caught between two different approaches to \\nthe environment. The public reacted in a way that we did not expect and the \\npressure groups used the Spar as a symbol in a way we did not anticipate.” \\n \\nAt least for the top brass at Shell, the two key factors behind this emerging \\n“ghost” were the communications revolution and the gradual loss of trust in established institutions. The two, it turns out, are closely interrelated. Earlier \\ngenerations learnt about the world directly from figures of authority — their parents, \\nteachers, coaches, and local political leaders. The media were important, but they also tended to be more deferential to authority, less given to attacking established \\ninstitutions. How things have changed. \\nNew technologies enable us all to compare what these authority figures say to \\nthe thoughts and perspectives of different, competing authority figures. As a result \\nof the transparency trend examined in Chapter 7, the public has suffered a “loss of \\ninnocence.” As Herkströter concluded: \\n \\n“once it is gone, it can never be regained. Today the world visible to any one \\nperson, anywhere on the planet, is becoming increasingly fragmented. The speed and immediacy of modern communications ensures that this process \\nwill continue. National governments, political parties, institutionalised \\nreligions, academic institutions, will never regain the authority they used to have — that ability to exclusively define the world view of large segments of \\nthe population.” \\n \\nImperialist or Relativist? \\nInternally, Shell’s own management culture was also clearly responsible for a fair \\nproportion of the company’s problems. The company, according to Herkströter, \\nsuffered from “a type of technical arrogance which is rather common in companies with a strong technical base.

That sort of approach works well with a \\nphysical problem — but is not so useful when we are faced with, say, a human rights issue. For most engineering problems there is a correct answer. For most social and \\npolitical dilemmas there is a range of possible answers — almost all compromises. \\nSo, starting off with a strong, scientifically grounded mind-set, we tended to misjudge some of the softer issues and consequently make mistakes.” \\nWhich was odd, given that Shell had a long head start. Its ethical standards were \\npublished in the 1970s, in the form of a Statement of General Business Principles. These have underpinned the company’s efforts to build a reputation for honesty and \\nintegrity, but were subsequently revisited in the wake of the 1995 controversies to \\nsee whether they were likely to be well-tuned to the needs and expectations of the 21st century. \\nShell — along with many other companies — will have to wrestle with some \\nfundamental ethical dilemmas. “The question of so-called double standards is a classic example,” notes Herkströter: \\n \\n“There are groups who call for one set of standards — whether it be for \\nwages, environment or any other issue — to be applied world wide. It seems \\nthat some people believe that their values are universal and that they can be \\napplied no matter what the cost or the social implications for those concerned.” \\n \\nThe danger for international companies is that they will inevitably and \\nincreasingly find themselves uncomfortably squeezed between those Shell dubs the \\n“moral relativists,” who argue that they should apply local standards, and those it \\nsees as “moral imperialists” — who would impose a single standard on the whole globe. Both are wrong, Shell would argue. Certainly recent controversies have \\nshown that what is acceptable in one country can be totally unacceptable in other \\ncountries. And developing countries and transition economies will often insist that they must strike a different balance between triple bottom line priorities — to build \\nor protect their competitive edge. All of which can leave the multinational \\ncorporation as the “piggy in the middle.” \\nThese issues are not simply philosophical: they are fundamental to the future of \\ncapitalism and to the societies that have chosen to develop capitalist economies.

But in a world of continuing economic, social, and political diversity there will \\nbe no total solutions. \\nBubbling Under \\nDrawing the Line \\nThe evidence suggests that the global collision of value systems will intensify in the \\nfuture. A good place to look for signals on how this debate is going to evolve is the \\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO), which is charged with wiping out barriers to \\nglobal trade. The late 1990s saw a widening philosophical gulf between the developed and developing countries on the role of the WTO. For example, the US \\nClinton Administration, pressured by unions and corporations, has been pushing to \\nremove “invisible” barriers such as corruption, which drives up the costs of entering some markets, and poor labor conditions, which US unions argue give Asian \\nproducers an unfair advantage.\\n24 \\nAsian trade negotiators, however, see western pressure on such issues as an \\nunwarranted intrusion into their societies and cultures. “Where do you draw the \\nline?” demanded Aznam Yusof, deputy director general at the Malaysian Institute of \\nStrategic and International Studies. “Do we discuss the climate or traffic jams? You could go on and on.” \\nThese are fair questions. And, at least in the world of business, international \\nresearch shows that there are major differences between the values of executives based in different world regions.

In Asia, the \\nJapanese were much more inclined to favour harmony, Singaporeans an orderly \\nsociety, the Taiwanese self-reliance, and Thais the achievement of financial success. \\nFuture corporate strategies must clearly recognize this diversity.

Honesty was enormously appreciated in most cases, \\nalthough many North American companies remain acutely sensitive about the \\nprospect of disclosure leading to litigation — and Japanese companies, some of which have been known to use reports produced by foreign competitors for \\nintelligence purposes, remain concerned about the competitive implications. \\nCertainly, it is worth thinking hard before deciding to report. As we warned in \\nour 1993 report Coming Clean , “any company that forgets that the [sustainability] \\ndebate can be a minefield is in danger of losing its corporate legs. Don’t expect \\nbouquets just because you have decided to open your books.” In some countries, plant managers can be jailed for failing to comply with emission controls. And any \\nreporting company would be well advised to read its final draft report with the eye \\nof a committed enemy of capitalism. If not, it risks being ambushed. \\nThat said, some of the most effective, and best received, reports have been those \\nwhere the reporting company has been prepared to adopt a “warts and all” approach. \\nThose who have taken this path have found that stakeholders are much more likely to believe the good news where there is also a frank, detailed discussion of the \\nremaining problems. \\n \\nAm I a Stakeholder? \\nIt is difficult to overstate the importance of stakeholders in driving — or stalling — \\nthe sustainability transition. And any stakeholder analysis needs to distinguish \\nbetween “traditional” and “emerging” stakeholders.6 Traditional stakeholders \\ninclude shareholders, lenders, regulators, and government policymakers. Emerging \\nstakeholder include employees, customers and consumers, trade associations and \\ncoalitions, professional and academic organizations, and community and environmental groups. Emerging stakeholders can also include “surrogate \\nstakeholders” for interests not traditionally represented — including the planet’s \\nbiosphere, the world population, and future generations. If business is to satisfy the growing demand from both stakeholder groups for improved triple bottom line \\nstandards and performance, it must learn to manage the dialogue in radically new \\nways. \\nYesterday’s stakeholders, almost exclusively, were concerned with maximizing \\nreturn for shareholders and investors (asking such questions as, “Is my money safe?” \\nand “Will this be a profitable company longer term?”).

Now the concept of sustainable development, with its triple bot tom line, is helping to ensure that \\ntomorrow’s stakeholders will include increasingly powerful representation of natural \\nresource, biospheric, North/South, and intergenerational equity interests (“Is this company — indeed, this industry — sustainable?”). \\nRemember, as argued in Chapter 4, sustainable development will be most likely, \\nand will be achieved at the lowest overall cost to the economy, in those societies where there are the highest levels of trust and other forms of “social capital.” \\nDifficult decisions will be easier to take and the time-scales for change will be \\nshorter. Conversely, low trust societies typically experience higher friction, resulting in added costs. \\nThe levels, and credibility, of information disclosure both by companies and by \\ngovernment agencies will play a key role in influencing the extent to which social capital is created, conserved, effectively invested, or eroded in any given society. \\nIndeed, as we see in Chapter 9, the reporting activities of recent years have done a \\ngreat deal to prepare the way for some of the new strategic partnerships now beginning to form between farsighted companies and pragmatic campaigning \\ngroups. \\nWhat’s New, Gurus? \\nEmotion is OK \\nTransparency, of course, can be achieved before or after the event.

The expansion was expected to double production at the site, \\nalready Intel’s largest, and create over 2,000 new jobs. But such plants need a lo t \\nof water. Unfortunately, a few months later the US Geological Survey concluded \\nthat the aquifer supplying the region’s water was far smaller than had bee n \\nthought. \\nThe New Mexico state engineer ruled that Intel could only pump just ove r \\n70% of the water it had said it would need.

And the further \\nglobalization proceeds, the greater the risk that outrage will be caused by events in \\nplaces which would once have been, in every sense, beyond the horizon. \\nOnce confronted with outraged campaigners or communities, the natural \\ntendency on the part of business people is to reject opposing views as “pure \\nemotion,” with the implications that they are thereby ruled out of court. But the \\nlikelihood is that business will face even greater eruptions of outrage as the values shift proceeds and the world moves into the globalized, highly competitive future \\nnow being sketched out and planned for by mainstream business gurus and their \\ncorporate clients. Major controversies stir emotions on all sides, not just among protesters. “Too often, my clients get locked into issues of control, ego and \\nvindication,” says Sandman.\\n8 \\nBased on his work with such corporate clients as ARCO, DuPont, Intel, and \\nUnion Carbide, Sandman explains that public outrage is a factor that almost every \\nbusiness risks having to deal with at some point. Perceived risk, he notes, is usually \\na complex, volatile mix of hazard and outrage. One of the first things he does is try to get business people to accept that emotions are legitimate — the public’s and their \\nown, “I tell them, look, just as the community’s outrage gets in the way of their \\nrational assessment of the hazard, your outrage gets in the way of your rational assessment of the community’s outrage.” \\nThe best approach, Sandman believes, is to “come clean” with the public and \\nother stakeholders. More radical still, he suggests that stakeholders be given a say in how the project — and even the company — is managed. As an example of best \\npractice, he points to BP’s handling of an oil spill at Huntingdon Beach, California. \\nAlthough a contract carrier was to blame, when asked if BP was responsible BP’s chief executive replied: “Our lawyers tell us it is not our fault. But we feel like it is \\nour fault and we are going to act like it is our fault.” Six months later, Sandman \\nrecalls, a survey showed that BP “had gained stature because of how they handled the spill.” \\nOutrage is expressed in different ways in different countries. An issue that might \\nbe framed as a control issue in the USA may be seen as a trust issue in Germany. Sandman explains that, “Where people in the United States are basically saying, \\n‘How dare you control my life,’ in Germany they’re saying ‘I want a more reliable \\nparent, a more trustworthy boss.’ ” These differences are becoming more important as companies increasingly trade across national boundaries and in different world \\nregions. For those facing outrage, Sandman offers the following advice: ', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 183}),\n",

Logically, before companies began to \\nreport externally on their environmental performance, initial efforts would have been focused upon developing appropriate environmental accounting methodologies and \\nindicators for measuring performance and then installing systems for auditing \\nagainst these. Only then would a company report be produced and verified. Instead, as Figure 7.1 suggests, the process has often seemed to run backwards. Many \\ncompanies have tended to start off with auditing, followed by reporting before \\nrealizing that their management systems were not really up to the task of producing the necessary information.

The other \\npioneer, Monsanto, did not opt for verification, nor, at the time of writing, is its \\nlatest report verified. But a growing number of reporting frameworks call for \\nverification, including the European Union’s EMAS scheme and the Danish and Dutch reporting requirements. \\nThere are a number of emerging issues surrounding verification, however. First, \\nthere is a striking contrast between the styles of verification adopted by accountancy firms and the more challenging approaches developed by some environmental \\nmanagement consultancies. Furthermore, some companies are focusing on having \\ntheir reports verified, while others (among them Bristol-Myers Squibb, Dow Europe and Sun Company) have simply had their environmental management systems or \\nauditing programmes verified. It is often not easy to tell which approach to \\nverification has been adopted without reading the text very closely. \\nEven so, research by the US Investor Responsibility Research Center (IRRC) \\nsuggests that environmental reports “have risen quickly to become a trusted source \\nof information for advocacy groups, institutional investors, investment managers, news media, environmental regulators, and other stakeholders.”\\n10 It is true that most \\nstakeholders currently see basic forms of verification adding very little to the \\ncredibility of current reports, but many also see verification emerging as a standard requirement in future — as it has in financial reporting. \\n \\n3 Benchmarkability \\nAnyone who has tried to compare or benchmark reports, even those produced by \\ncompanies operating in the same industry sector, will recognize that the task is \\nusually impossible. With companies choosing their own environmental performance \\nindicators and other metrics, benchmarking is still often more a hope than a reality. This is a key problem, given the role comparability plays in making reports credible. \\nOne reason for the current failure to ensure benchmarkability may be simple fear \\nabout the possible outcome. But another reason appears to be that report-makers are failing to recognize and respond to the emerging needs of report users, most \\nparticularly financial analysts and institutions. Whereas most reporting companies \\nstill see their reports as a form of reassurance for the outside world, growing numbers of report users want to use the data reported to compare, benchmark, rank, \\nand rate companies.

Longer term, \\nhowever, we will see companies recognizing a need to get a better grip on a wider \\nrange of triple bottom line issues and on performance up and down the value chain; from “cradle to grave” (see Chapter 8). In the process, some reporting companies are \\nfinding that what started out as a public affairs activity is beginning to have a strong \\ninfluence on corporate strategy and business design. \\nFurther pressure in this direction will be generated by interest in new concepts \\nsuch as “eco-efficiency,” “environmental space,” and the “Factor 4” through “Factor \\n10” approaches to dematerialization. That said, there remains a real danger that the growing focus of many report-makers on continuous improvement, an approach \\ndrawn across from Total Quality Management (TQM), coupled with the spreading \\nuse of TQM-derived benchmarking tools, will blind them to the much more fundamental steps that may need to be taken on the road to sustainability. This sort \\nof blind-spot is best dealt with through stakeholder dialogue processes which \\nchallenge current mindsets and promote lateral or “out-of-the-box” thinking. \\n \\n5 Impacts and Outcomes \\nData on industry’s inputs and outputs are obviously welcome, but they are only really useful if they can be linked to real-world environmental impacts — and to programmes for reducing and making good those impacts. The necessary shifts here \\nare from data to information and knowledge, from understanding to action. In short, \\nwhat do all the emissions and waste data published in these reports actually mean in terms of environmental decline or progress, let alone of longer term sustainability? \\nOne of the first steps in the right direction came in a recent Dow Europe report. \\n“The figures we present often raise the question: ‘How do these emissions impact the environment?,’ ” the company explained.\\n11 Interestingly, the report also included \\na review of the methodology by CE, the Delft-based environmental think-tank. To \\nachieve genuine progress, such data and targets need to be linked firstly to government sustainability frameworks and targets, and secondly to market (and \\nparticularly financial market) requirements and incentives.

The question of whether to adopt ad-hoc or global operating standards can tax even the best reporters. \\nThe titanium dioxide producer Tioxide (now part of DuPont) has produced both \\ngroup-level and site-level reports covering countries as diverse as the UK, Spain, South Africa, and Malaysia.

This transition will need to involve a wider set of stakeholders than is implied by the conventional relationship between managers, directors, and owners. It will also \\nrequire a fuller and more integrated vision of corporate accountability. Meanwhile, \\nat least for the equity and other fast-paced financial markets, environmental issues are often overshadowed by the sheer scale of the problems that have rocked \\ninstitutions like Barings, Daiwa, and Sumitomo.

When we \\nheld roundtables for financial analysts in London, New York, and Tokyo as part of the Coming Clean project, most financial analysts said they simply binned the \\nenvironmental reports they received as useless. A few years on, most have yet to \\nchange their minds. Most analysts, according to Bill Birchard, still: \\n \\n“wrinkle up their noses at the thought of seriously studying green reports. So \\ndo the debt analysts. When Moody’s Investor Service or Standard & Poor’s come to figure out whether a company can pay quarterly coupons and return \\nof principal on a debt issue, they find that environmental capital and operating \\ncosts simply consume too small a share of cash flow to make a difference.”\\n21 \\n \\nBut insurance analysts and some banks are beginning to give some of these \\nreports a closer look. “The forthrightness is a good indicator of the quality of management,” noted Bill McElroy, an assistant vice president in Zurich-America’s \\ncommercial real estate group in New York. Meanwhile, across at Swiss Bank \\nCorporation (SBC), Franz Knecht, vice president and head of environmental management services, foresees the day when SBC bankers will summarily refuse \\nloans to marginal clients because of their failure to provide environmental reports. \\nConversely, he suggest, companies that provide sound data could find their loan applications being processed faster, a considerable advantage when time is money. \\n \\nHoly Grail? \\nAs the interest of financial markets inevitably grows, so will the interest in ways of \\ninternalizing triple bottom line costs without wrecking companies.

If we want to \\ninternalize such costs, he asks, “can accountants deliver the new holy grail of \\nsustainability ‘full cost accounting?’ ”22 \\nUltimately, however, he argues that the voluntary approach is not going to \\ndeliver either full cost accounting or sustainability. “Internalisation of environmental \\ncosts has occurred — and continues to occur — to some degree,” he says: \\n \\n“Changes in customer taste, increased (if patchy) regulation, new taxation \\ninitiatives, and increased costs of control have all added new costs (and \\nperhaps opened new opportunities) for both organisations and individuals. They do so, however, in an uneven way. Some companies in some industries \\n— have been hit hard, others — perhaps even in the same industry — have, so \\nfar, escaped unscathed.” \\n \\nMost companies continue to enjoy a “free ride” at the expense both of those \\npioneering companies that have made a start on internalizing costs and of the wider environment. However transparent the operating environment in which it does \\nbusiness, a company ultimately must face financial reality. If internalizing a range of \\ntriple bottom line costs starts to threaten stock market valuations, salaries or jobs, then only regulations will swing the argument.

First, all of us have used products made of \\naluminum, so let’s focus on the plight of Canada’s beluga whales. Then we will \\nmove on to alligator penises, mad cows, sustainable paper, T-shirts made by sweatshop labor, the growing pressure on those who make the 15 billion cigarettes \\nsmoked every day, and the airbags designed to save adults which turned out to kill \\nchildren. \\n \\nLife-cycle Detectives \\nAs a modern parable, illustrating the complex, apparently chaotic way in which today’s problems can evolve, consider the beluga whales of Canada’s great St Lawrence river. “Because belugas make an extraordinary range of noises — from \\nwhistles and creaks to clicks and warbles,” explains Pierre Béland, one of the \\nscientists involved, “the seafarers who first heard them named them sea canaries.”\\n3 \\nSadly, they have also turned out to play the same role that canaries once played in \\nmines: signalling rising pollution levels by dying. \\nHunted and trapped for thousands of years by those who lived alongside the \\nriver, these small white whales came tinder massive hunting pressure between the \\nmid-1800s and 1900s. There were once an estimated 100,000 belugas; today there \\nare fewer than 500. Yet, despite the fact that the belugas were totally protected in 1979, their population failed to recover. Among the possible reasons s uggested were \\nlow natural reproductive rates and the destruction of beluga habitat by hydroelectric \\nprojects. But recent research has spotlighted a more worrying factor. \\nAs industry began to develop in the region, dead belugas started to turn up. \\nLaboratory tests showed that their bodies were so contaminated by industrial \\npollutants that they were soon being classified as toxic waste. A possible source of the pollutants was one of the world’s largest aluminum-producing complexes, which \\nfor decades released large quantities of a highly potent carcinogen, benzo(a)pyrene, \\ninto one of the St Lawrence’s tributaries, the Sanguenay. \\nTo begin with, scientists found it hard to work out how the whales had become \\nso contaminated. Admittedly, they fed on invertebrates in the river’s headwaters, but \\n— although the invertebrates were themselves contaminated — this source was', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 206}),\n",

Another \\nspecies that can build up very high levels of persistent pollutants is the eel. The \\nscientists suddenly realised that the migrating eels swim smack through the middle \\nof the belugas’ habitat. And it turned out that they might be contributing as much as half of the contaminants found in the whales. “I felt like a naive detective who had \\nbeen trying to figure out how packages move between cities by searching highway \\nvehicles at random,” recalled Pierre Béland. “I got nowhere until I chanced on a mail truck.” \\nNor did the story stop there. It was found that female whales were consistently \\nless contaminated than the males. Why? The answer turned out to be a key part of the explanation for the whales’ low reproductive rate: the females were passing \\nastounding amounts of pollutants on to their calves in their milk. The conclusion \\nwas that, far from recovering from pollution, successive generations of whales were becoming increasingly contaminated. \\nNo one actively set out to poison the belugas. For years the damage continued \\nwithout anyone understanding why it was happening. The St Lawrence, in effect, was being used as a giant environmental laboratory. This was simply one more case \\nof the life-cycle effects of technology being swept under the ecological carpet. \\nNowadays, however, we can no longer plead ignorance. \\n \\nShrinking Penises \\nAnd just in case the fate of Canadian belugas seems a bit remote from the day-to-day cares of running any business but an aluminum smelter, it is worth noting that such problems can hit almost any business these days. Recall the enormous controversy \\nwhen scientists showed that phthalates, which are suspected of causing human \\nfertility problems, could be found in most brands of baby milk. Phthalates, widely used as “plasticizers” to make materials like PVC softer and more flexible, share \\nwith many other industrial chemicals the ability to mimic the effect on the body of \\nestrogen, the female sex hormone. Environmental campaigners have linked phthalates to recent evidence of declining sperm counts and increasing testicular \\ncancer in men.\\n4 \\n“What do the breakdown of the family, dead whales, shrunken alligator penises, \\nhyperactive children, disappearing frogs, and breast cancer have in common?” the \\nnormally calm Business Week asked its readers.

In the immediate aftermath, some 4,000 people \\n— or around half the workforce — were laid off by the 90 largest UK abattoirs. \\nCompanies that were sitting on stocks of meat estimated to have a potential market value of 179 million suddenly found their asset value more or less halved overnight. \\nThe Road Haulage Association said that about 8,500 drivers and support staff had \\nbeen laid off and 5,000 trucks involved in transporting animals, animal feed, and meat had been forced off the road. In Germany, meanwhile, beef consumption \\nplummeted by 70% in the first week after the scare broke — and only slowly \\nrecovered to the 50% level. Across the European Union, beef consumption was estimated to have dropped by 30%. \\nAnd what was perhaps most interesting about the disaster was that experts had \\nbeen warning of the dangers for years. One had even called for the slaughter of six million cows six years earlier, warning that anyone under the age of 50 should avoid \\nbeef. He was derided in articles based on government briefings, excluded from \\nexpert panels and denied research funding.\\n9 The attempted cover-up was among the \\nmost blatant of recent times, but — as will increasingly be the case — failed to \\nprotect the government, the industries hiding behind its skirts, or the victims of the \\ndisease. \\nOnce the lid came off the UK meat industry, it seemed incredible only that the \\ndisaster had taken so long to erupt. Not that the UK was alone in finding out \\nextraordinary things when the X-ray environment switched on. In Switzerland, for example, it was discovered that thousands of human placentas from hospitals had \\nbeen used since the 1960s to make animal feed. How could the practice, which \\nbreached hospital waste disposal guidelines, have gone undetected for so long? But, that said, the UK was the country with the real problems. \\nThe root causes of these problems turned out to include the economics of the \\nbeef industry, the government’s deregulation of the animal feed industry, and the unbelievably cavalier attitudes of the boards of some of the major companies \\ninvolved. \\nWhen BSE first surfaced as an issue, in 1986, the UK Government decided to \\nexclude from the food chain tissues most likely to include the suspected infective \\nagents, proteins known as prions.

But the beef industry is notoriously suspicious of outsiders, \\nruled by informal agreements, and often poorly managed.10 Indeed, the Observer  \\nnoted, “as BSE became more common, farmers got better at spotting it before it became obvious.” In this way, it was feared, “thousands of diseased cows may have \\ngone to market.” Magistrates’ courts handled a string of cases in which farmers were \\naccused of passing off diseased animals as healthy. \\nOne step further along the food chain were the abattoirs. They serve a market \\nplagued by over-capacity, resulting in intense competition and very low profit \\nmargins. As a result, many middle range abattoirs constantly operate on the verge of financial collapse. Attempts to set up quality meat schemes were usually \\nundermined by cut-throat competition. Internal quality controls were generally poor, \\nwith abattoir workers being semiskilled and poorly paid, so quality issues are seen to be management’s responsibility not the worker’s. External controls were also deeply \\nflawed, with former meat inspectors saying they had an average of only two minutes \\nto check a carcass. To begin with, at least, serious shortcomings identified by spot-checks were insufficiently pursued by the health authorities, at a time when the \\nauthorities were, in any event, leaning over backwards to persuade the public that \\nBritish beef was safe. \\nAnother link in the chain turned out to be what is known as rendering, where \\nabattoir wastes are cooked and crushed to make such products as tallow and bone \\nmeal. Inspections found that fully 75% of the renderers were failing to meet the relevant regulations. The rendering industry is dominated by a single firm, Prosper \\nde Mulder. The firm accounted for around two-thirds of red meat waste acquired for \\nrendering in England and Wales, enjoyed a return on capital of more than 30% and yet operated in what was politely described as a “highly informal way.” According \\nto the Observer , “there were no minutes of board meetings.” Nor was it simply a \\ncase of inadequate management systems. “The company appeared to have little respect for the regulatory authorities,” the paper reported.\\n11 \\nThe conclusion was that “For a decade, at least, much of the industry has been \\ngoverned by a culture of organized irresponsibility.” But, inevitably, a massive price would be paid by the industry. For the short term, it was being kept alive by \\nconsuming itself. \\n“Renderers used to recycle unwanted animal parts to make products for \\nindustry; now theirs is largely a waste disposal business.

Unfortunately, as the airbag \\nstory demonstrates, there is what some scientists call the “law of unintended \\nconsequences.” Every time we act to address one set of problems, the chances are \\nthat we unintentionally set in train a new rash of problem. Often, the benefits of the action hugely outweigh the new problems, but not always. In the case of airbags, \\nthey have turned out to have a particularly nasty habit of killing young passengers. \\n“Airbags have been blamed for the deaths of 22 babies and small children so far — eight last year,” Fortune reported in 1996.\\n17 \\nOne reason why Americans are so fond of airbags, it turns out, is that many of \\nthem refuse to wear seat belts. Only around two-thirds of Americans routinely wear belts when driving. The pressure for airbags developed as an alternative way of \\nensuring driver and, increasingly, passenger safety. This was despite the evidence of \\ntests carried out by Volvo in 1974, with 24 small live pigs exposed to airbags in action to show the likely effect on 3- to 6-year-old children. The result was eight \\ndead pigs, with a further 13 seriously injured. \\nToday’s statistics suggest that, in any event, airbags work far better when a belt \\nis also worn — and that one baby or small child dies for every 70 or so lives saved. \\nAs I wrote this chapter, the US government announced that less powerful airbags \\nwould save the lives of dozens of children each year, yet could cost the lives of between 133 and 1,203 adults!\\n18 \\nComplicated.

The X-rays used to \\ndiagnose cancer may themselves cause cancer. The asbestos used to control fire hazards turned out to cause asbestosis.

By contrast, many of today’s disasters are expressed as a statistical \\ndeviation from “normal” background rates (as with lung cancer caused by smoking). \\nThe old disasters were mainly sudden and local: the new ones are often gradual and global, from radioactive isotopes in the 1950s milk to climate change in the 1990s. \\nThe technological dream of a self-correcting, risk-free world is as much an \\nillusion as John von Neumann’s 1955 prediction of energy too cheap to meter by 1980.

Included would be mistakes which need making \\ngood, production of goods that no one turns out to want, processing steps which are \\nnot actually needed, use-less movement of people and materials from one place to another, and goods which fail to meet customer needs and expectations. The lean \\nthinking mindset is based on five principles: \\n \\n♦ First, companies need to understand the value created by each specific product. \\n♦ Second, they must identify the value stream for the product. \\n♦ Third, value should flow without interruptions. \\n♦ Fourth, the customer should be encouraged to pull value through the entire \\nsystem. \\n♦ And, fifth, all those involved should pursue perfection . The focus of attention is \\ndirected at “the entire firm, indeed at the whole value stream for specific \\nproducts, running from raw material to finished g ood, order to delivery, and \\nconcept to launch.” \\n \\nWomack and Jones believe that lean thinking is “counterintuitive and a bit \\ndifficult to grasp on first encounter (but then blindingly obvious once ‘the light comes on’).” Environmental issues only get a couple of quick look-ins as they spool \\nout their thinking over 350 pages.

His book, Driving Eco-Innovation ,22 co-written with Peter James, explores \\nsome of the ways in which the fields of innovation and sustainability are now \\nbeginning to overlap. \\nThe real problem we face, Fussler argues, is “innovation lethargy.” Many of the \\ntechnologies we have developed may seem hugely sophisticated to us, but in reality \\nthey are crawling along at the bottom of the evolutionary scale. When Professor Robert Ayres looked at the energy efficiency of a number of major end uses in the \\nus, for example, he found that the efficiency of air cooling systems ranged between \\n0.7% and 5%; cooking and water heating between 0.3% and 3%; and lighting between 0.7% and 7%. Appalling. \\nOur innovation lethargy is simultaneously a problem for the environment and for \\nour economies, Fussler points out. The problem, in a nutshell, is that we are too often happier focusing on smaller, incremental improvements to existing \\ntechnologies rather than on the process of “super-innovation” which produces \\ntechnologies “which reshape economic and social possibilities by creating a new performance curve and new forms of demand.” \\nOne real problem here is that the gap between the initial invention and \\nwidespread use can be a matter of decades, as in the case of the jet engine and the transistor. The jet engine was invented in 1928, took its first flight in 1941 and, even \\nso, was only adopted in military aircraft during the 1950s and civil aircraft in the \\n1960s. Computer chips, which are currently subject to Moore’s Law (which holds that they will double their power and halve their size every 18 months), are currently \\non the vertically climbing part of the standard “S-curve” of product innovation. \\nMade in 1965 by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, the forecast has been remarkably prescient and has held true for the past 35 years, helping to propel semiconductor \\nproduction into a $ 150-billion-a-year industry.\\n23 But Fussler notes that it took the \\nindustry 25 years to move from the transistor’s discovery to the first real integrated circuit, the Intel 8008 microprocessor. \\nThe key to long-term success, then, is to keep an eve on emerging technologies \\nand emerging inflexion points in the S-curves, when periods of super-rapid innovation and technical progress are about to begin. Not that “surfers of the S-\\ncurves” will always find it easy to spot the developing wave. How many businesses \\npredicted the rapid phase-out of CFCs? “Surfers will follow the maxim: move before you have to,” says Fussler. “Replace current products, ahead of competitors, with \\nnew ones which address fundamental long-term needs.” \\nBut how can you identify emerging vulnerabilities and opportunities ahead of', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 218}),\n",

The eco-compass has six \\npoles or dimensions (see Figure 8. 1), designed to capture all significant \\nenvironmental issues. A key advantage is that, instead of thinking about each dimension separately, the compass allows new product development teams to \\nexplore all the dimensions simultaneously, including any significant \\ninterrelationships between them. The six eco-compass dimensions are: \\n \\n♦ health and environmental potential risk  \\n♦ resource conservation \\n♦ energy intensity \\n♦ materials intensity \\n♦ revalorization (remanufacturing, reuse, and recycling) \\n♦ and service extension (a measure of improved service from a given quantity \\nof inputs, for example by improving product durability) \\n The eco-compass is mainly designed to drive and record improvements towards \\nthe minimum “Factor 4” targets set by sustainability experts based at organizations \\nlike Germany’s Wuppertal Institute and the US Rocky Mountain Institute.

The targets for the end of 1996/ 97 were 88% and 57%, respectively. \\nOn the peat front, Sainsbury’s Homebase stores have managed to meet 20% \\nof demand through peat substitutes. The 1996/97 target was to build a database \\non peat substitutes, which seemed weak, But the company’s reporting team told \\nme that they needed to get the peat buyers on side before they tried to “distort” \\nthe market towards sustainability.

SustainAbility has worked with both and it sometimes seems that they \\nregard one another with a mutual loathing unrivalled since the Cold War. But P&G \\nhas emerged as one of the world’s leaders when it comes to the use of LCA and of a related approach, value: impact assessment. \\nAs Peter Hindle, responsible for environmental affairs in Europe, explains: \\n \\n“Society expects that the products and services that it buys and uses will be \\nsafe for people and for the environment. It also expects that those involved in \\nmaking the products or providing the services will work in safe conditions and that the production processes will not injure the environment.” \\n \\nBut, he notes, these “bold statements beg the question: ‘How safe is safe?’ ” \\nEach of us accepts certain levels of risk every day, whether we are crossing the road, \\ndriving a car, or traveling in an aircraft. That said, the ways in which we experience \\nand respond to risks depend enormously on the degree to which we have control over, or at least a say in, the risk-generating activities: \\n \\n“For everyday consumer goods such as laundry detergents, dishwashing \\nliquids, baby diapers, shampoos, toothpaste, skin cream and colour cosmetics, \\npeople expect the products to be safe under conditions of use and reasonably \\nforeseeable misuse. This includes worker safety, user safety and environmental safety.” \\n \\nSo far, so ordinary, you may say. But P&G has also been trying to internalize at \\nleast some of the new requirements of sustainable development. For much of the \\n1990s, the company distilled the complexity of the challenge down into a single \\nphrase: “More from Less.” “The ongoing societal debate on the concept of sustainable development centers on the appropriate balance between economic \\ngrowth (how much ‘more’) and environmental quality effects (how much ‘less’),” \\nHindle explains. \\nAchieving more from less requires a systematic approach that measures two \\ncomparatives: “more” and “less.” In P&G’s “value: impact assessment” approach, \\n“more” relates to consumer value, “less” to environmental impact. Noting that many early “green” products turned out to offer “less from less,” the company set out to \\nensure that products that offered an improved environmental performance also \\ndelivered the benefits that consumers want, ensuring that people want to buy and', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 222}),\n",

Only if these improved products displace existing products, it argues, will \\nthe environmental benefits be significant. \\nThe value assessment part of the process uses different criteria to evaluate a \\nproduct’s “fitness for use.” How well a product works often depends on how the consumer uses it, which means that research needs to be carried out on actual, rather \\nthan just recommended, usage. Once these data are in, the company can proceed to \\nthe impact and risk assessment stages of the process. \\nUsed in conjunction with the development of P&G’s new “compact” detergents, \\ndesigned to deliver more laundry benefits with a reduced volume of chemicals, the \\napproach led in the space of a few years to European consumers using 386,000 tonnes less chemicals than would otherwise have been the case. A side-benefit was \\nthat the impacts that would have been associated with the manufacture, distribution, \\nand use of these chemicals were also avoided. \\nAn illustration, in short, of how lean thinking can help in the sustainability \\ntransition. But if we are to move towards the Factor 4 — et alone Factor 10 — \\nimprovements, corporate boards are going to need a sharp nudge from markets, particularly from the financial markets. Such pressures are beginning to build. \\n \\nSharpest Tool \\nPerhaps not surprisingly, the real board-level pressure is coming from sectors that \\nhave a vested interest in adopting a lifecycle perspective, most notably the insurers, \\nrather than in optimizing short-term return on equity, like most financial analysts, \\nCorporate boards have not seen insurers as sustainability campaigners, but many soon will. Insurers are no keener on losing money than the rest of us, and the \\npotential losses they face because of environmental risks are getting ever larger. \\n“Insurance companies are both affected by environmental problems and can \\nmake an important contribution to sustainable development,” says Frank \\nAnnighöfer, chairman of the board at Germany’s Gerling Consulting, part of a major \\ninsurance group.\\n24 There are many ways in which insurance companies can cut the \\nenvironmental impact of their activities, not least through green housekeeping \\nmeasures — involving minimizing the impact of such areas as office cleaning, \\ncomputing and furnishing. \\nBut, as Annighöfer continues, “the sharpest tool that an insurance company has \\nis not housekeeping but its insurance products — the risks covered or not covered in \\nan insurance contract and the premium for the insurance cover.

But \\n25 years ago, Gerling decided to offer its EHS expertise to industry and government via Gerling Consulting, and now operates the service from 12 offices across Europe. \\nAmong the areas covered are site audits, risk control strategies, and hazardous waste \\nremediation. Longer term, an even more important lever that Gerling and other insurers can pull is the investment one. Insurance companies have to invest billions \\nof dollars earned from premiums and Gerling has also now entered the field of \\nenvironmentally sound investment, working along-side Norway’s Storebrand in building up the Environmental Value Fund described in Chapter 13. \\nIf such initiatives take off, they will provide a further stimulus to corporate \\nboards wondering whether they should pay greater attention to the risks lurking up and down their value chains. Few companies will be able to sustain a lifecycle \\nworldview on an ongoing basis, let alone full 7-D vision. But every time a major \\nnew issue surfaces, we will see corporate auditing teams racing around the world to see whether the same thing could happen again, in a different place, to a different \\nindustry or company. As a logical end-point of the value: impact assessment \\napproach, some companies may even find themselves beginning to think the unthinkable — and wondering whether the high-to-medium risk processes they \\noperate or products they offer are really necessary. \\nBubbling Under \\nDesigning for Sustainability \\nLifecycle assessment (LCA) has now escaped from the laboratory into the market. \\nAs a result, we are seeing growing numbers of companies trying to integrate \\nlifecycle thinking into their new product development processes. One company \\nSustainAbility has worked with throughout the 1990s as it addressed the task of \\nenvironmental product design is ICI Polyurethanes (ICI PU). The company makes \\npolyurethane foams, widely used in furniture and mattresses, as well as in building \\ninsulation, car steering wheels, and refrigerator insulation.25 ', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 224}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Life-cycle Technology 211 \\nThe challenge, as Vanja Markovic (now with ICI Acrylics) recalled, was to use \\nLCA as a means “to develop a product with reduced environmental impact during \\nthe whole life cycle.” This is a complex business, with two main types of \\npolyurethane, TDI and MDI. In this case, ICI PU decided to work with MDI in developing its “Waterlily” foam product. LCA was used to carry out a broad brush \\nanalysis of the main environ mental impacts throughout the life cycle of foams used \\nin furniture. The exercise focused on five main stages of the process: raw material manufacture, product fabrication, packaging and transport, use, and waste \\nmanagement. The main benefit of the exercise, says Dr Markovic, was “to draw \\nattention to the importance of the raw material manufacturing stage,” which proved to account for 80% of lifecycle energy consumption. \\nGiven that companies cannot do everything at once, one of the key advantages of \\nLCA is to help identify priorities. In this case, ICI PU decided that its priority had to be design-for-recycling. The Waterlily foam, which is now being sold to companies \\nlike IKEA, can be chemically recycled and future Waterlily foams could contain as \\nmuch as 70% recycled foam. Everything hangs, however, on how fast the pressures to recycle develop. Recyclability is one thing, recycling — coupled with the \\nsuccessful sale of products with a high level of recycled content — quite another. \\nICI PU will be worth watching to see whether it can scale up its recycling activities to ensure that future sleepers can rest assured that their mattresses will not end up \\nfurther clogging the world’s landfill sites. \\nIt is worth noting, however, that a product’s environmental performance is rarely \\nthe highest priority when it comes to determining competitive advantage. Other \\nattributes, among them price, performance, reliability, and quality, are usually more \\nimportant to commercial success. As we have seen in the P&G case, such attributes may themselves sometimes constitute environmental progress, but may not be \\nadvertised as such by the producer, let alone be seen as such by the end consumer. A \\nrecent study found that of a sample of 16 “green” products, environmental performance advantages alone were insignificant in conferring a competitive edge in \\n11 cases\\n26 What that tells us is simply that environmental performance is not a \\nsufficient condition for market success in most cases, but it will increasingly be a necessary condition. \\n \\nWho Needs It? \\nIf the life-cycle data continue to accumulate, the triple bottom line perspective will \\nbegin to raise real question marks over some products, processes and even', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 225}),\n",

And, as the sustainable production and consumption imperative builds, \\nwe will also hear increasing discussion of Factor 4–10 strategies. In parallel, the \\ngrowing use of LCA tools reflects both the pressures for higher levels of \\nenvironmental quality and for continuous improvement of product quality. \\nLife-cycle thinking and techniques can be applied to products, processes, or \\nsystems. It can focus on economic, environmental, or social costs and benefits. In \\nthe economic area, for example, a company may investigate the life-cycle benefits, costs, and impacts of its products, either hoping to cut them or to prove to customers \\nthat high initial purchase costs will be offset by lower overall life-cycle costs. \\nModern management approaches such as value engineering and value marketing \\ndepend on such life-cycle insights for their effectiveness. Now such techniques are \\nbeing applied to products to identify their life-cycle economic, environmental, and, \\nin some cases, social costs. What is interesting about the lean thinking approach is that it challenges the need for products and services. The sustainability agenda does \\nthe same — and to an even greater extent. As a result, companies determined to \\nremain at the cutting edge should be thinking of applying some form of “need test” to their product or service offerings. \\nSustainAbility’s “beta version” of a need test, developed alongside Dow Europe, \\nis shown in Figure 8.2.\\n27 An outline application, focusing on the dairy hormone  \\n \\nThe Diagnosis \\n1 What is the primary function of the product or servi ce? \\n2 What other benefits does the product or service offer? 3 Is there likely to be a long-term need and/or demand for the product or servi ce? \\n4 How does the value: impact assessment for the product or service look today? 5 Would the product or service be sustainable in an equitable world of 8–10 billion people? 6 Are there more sustainable ways of providing the function or meeting the need?  \\nThe Prognosis \\n7 Given 1–6, what threats and opportunities will there be for the product or service during the sustainability transition? \\n \\nFIGURE 8.2 The Need Test ( Source : SustainAbility) ', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 226}),\n",

With many companies already trying to slim down their supply chains to a smaller number of strategic suppliers, poor life-cycle \\nperformance (actual or perceived) will become a further reason for dropping \\nparticular companies. Many companies will not even know why they have been delisted. \\nThe winners in this new world will be those companies that have already X-\\nrayed much of their supply chain and operations for potential problems and moved to address any issues identified. The losers will include a high proportion of those \\nthat have not. For those determined to avoid this fate, the sustainability audit \\nframework outlined in Chapter 14 suggests some of the questions they should be asking. \\nEven the most seductive business strategies will need to be reviewed against this \\ntrend. So, for example, one emerging business strategy has been for manufacturers of ingredients or components of final consumer products as different as soft drinks \\nand personal computers to try to develop brand identities which come right through \\nthe supply chain. Examples include NutraSweet in soft drinks, Goretex and Lycra in clothing, Teflon in cooking utensils and Intel in computers. Other companies aiming \\nto move in the same direction include ICI Acrylics, with products (Lucite in the US, \\nPerspex in Europe) destined for use in baths, spas, and other “sanitaryware.” The potential downside of this strategy is that, while it can massively boost the \\nprofitability of particular components or ingredients, it also helps build the x-ray \\nenvironment. Companies which in the past simply had to worry about what industrial customers thought of’ them will increasingly have to worry — as Intel \\nnow does — about what end-consumers (and those who influence them) think. \\nAnd the fact that a technology offers major benefits in relation to one dimension \\nof the triple bottom line does not mean it will prove to be sustainable.

Paradoxically, the hostages included students \\nfrom Cambridge University who had been working with local tribes to learn how they exploited nature without destroying it. \\nThe Freeport McMoRan response to environmental challenges can only be \\ndescribed as robust. The scale of the pollution, Jim-Bob Moffett retorted, “is equivalent to me pissing in the Arafura Sea.” He told The Times that he was \\ninvolved in “a new Cold War” with local and international campaigners. “This,” he \\nsaid, “is not a job for us, it’s a religion.” All of which tends to make negotiation with the enemy, let alone the development of longer term partnerships, inconceivable. \\n \\nMonkey Traps \\nSuch reactions bring to mind the old “Monkey Trap” tale (Spotlight, p. 222). \\nCompanies like Freeport McMoRan would do well to learn and understand it. The \\nhistory of the environmental revolution is full of examples of companies locking \\nthemselves into various forms of monkey trap.

Whether the funding \\nwas for core costs, campaigns, or other initiatives, the relationship was simple. \\nCrudely stated, it was “Give us money and we will splash your name over some appropriate surface.” A few leading NGOs, particularly those dedicated to wildlife \\nconservation, developed huge corporate sponsorship departments dedicated solely to \\nhunting down deep-pocketed corporate donors. And, like the monkey with its fist in the trap, they too then tended to find that they were in no position to run effective \\ncampaigns against their new-found funding partners. Some companies even offered \\nfunding with the explicit aim of locking up potential enemies, or even of using them as Trojan horses. \\nIn any event, the conditions in which such partnerships were pursued changed \\ndramatically when two things happened in parallel. First, companies, inevitably, became more discriminating. They began to insist on a bigger PR bang for their \\nsponsorship buck. And they wanted their benefits in the form of an enhanced \\nreputation with selected audiences. As “cause-related marketing” evolved, some of those NGO corporate sponsorship departments became almost indistinguishable \\nfrom mainstream advertising or PR agencies. \\nThe second shift was driven by NGO needs. They found themselves managing \\nincreasingly large projects and budgets, Their staffs mushroomed and demanded \\nbetter employment conditions. They found they needed people, and project and \\nfinancial management skills which, they noted, business was also rich in. So we saw downsizing companies seconding managers to NGOs, often as a way of easing them \\ninto retirement. And we also saw NGOs appointing people from business to their \\nboards and top management posts. \\nIn a parallel trend, we saw leading campaigners being recruited by major \\ncompanies. Not all of these transfers worked. More than a few secondees, and some \\nof those actively headhunted, proved to be fish out of water. But enough of these grafts “took” to ensure that NGOs remain interested in finding new ways to access \\nthe human resources and skills available within their business partners — and \\ncompanies in finding ways to extract new forms of value from campaigning organizations or from ex-campaigners.

An early example was the string of “strange alliances” that Greenpeace pioneered in its \\n“Greenfreeze” campaign with companies like DKK Scharfenstein and Calor. \\nThe aim was to use Greenpeace’s marketing and communication muscle to help \\nlaunch ozone-friendly technology, which the prevailing refrigeration industry \\nconsensus said was unworkable.

As a result, growing numbers are experimenting with novel forms of NGO relation ship.

As a result, more environmental NGOs are experimenting with \\npartnership approaches to environmental and sustainability problems. \\nOne pioneer has been the US Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), which has \\nworked with companies as diverse as McDonald’s and General Motors.

This will enable us to use more environmentally friendly materials, \\nand fewer of them, which in turn will reduce waste, risk and costs.” \\n \\nIn the case of the EDF—S.C.

The convergence of these trends creates an \\nopportunity for new forms of partnership, but raises an interesting new issue. Many business people had argued that there were too many NGOs for comfort. If current \\ntrends continue, however, we may well see a shortage of credible NGOs willing and \\nable to work alongside, and invest their credibility in, particular companies or industry sectors.

Even so, confrontation is expected to continue in parallel — and \\nseveral factors could reverse the trend toward collaboration. In the USA, for example, Speaker Newt Gingrich and his Republicans managed to trigger a major \\nrethink among NGOs already working with companies with their attempts to \\nundermine existing environmental regulations. In the event, NGOs and their allies fought off the challenge, but both they and the companies they work with will need \\nto grapple with the internal “schizophrenia” partnerships can create within their own \\norganizations. Partnerships, even when well managed, can fuel schizophrenia both in companies and NGOs. \\nOf course, it is difficult to generalize about NGOs, given that they are so diverse. \\nThey concentrate on a wide array of environmental (and often social and economic) issues; span local, regional, national, and international “jurisdictions;” represent \\nnumerous forms of decision-making structure and management; and are driven by \\nwidely different political philosophies. Some NGOs are staffed by a handful of people, relying largely on volunteer efforts, while others are large, international, \\nhighly professionalized organizations. These inherent differences in form, agenda, \\nand style also extend to their views on developing relationships with business, whether in true partnerships or in dialogs. So before entering into an alliance with an \\nNGO, a company would want to know where the organization fits into the overall \\nsustainability movement. \\nTo make the diversity easier to grasp, we distinguish between four main types of \\nNGO, based on two separate sets of characteristics. First, consider the extent to \\nwhich the NGO seeks to integrate the role of businesses and “public interest” groups in achieving environmental goals. At one end of the spectrum, as Max Nichsolson \\nput it a couple of decades ago, are the integrators, placing a high priority on \\ndeveloping productive relationships with business, and striving to identify non-confrontational, “win—win” strategies. At the other end of this spectrum are the \\npolarizers . They have typically made a strategic decision not to develop close \\nworking relationships with business, preferring to concentrate instead on a watchdog role.

At the \\nother end of the spectrum, there are the non-discriminators . For them, a company’s \\nrelative environmental performance is not of particular interest.

As we saw in Chapter 5, James Moore’s \\nbook The Death of Competition introduced the notion of business ecosystems. The \\nchallenge for companies today is to work out how to integrate a growing range of \\npartners and stakeholders into these ecosystems. \\nThe advantages of this approach have also been explored by Fred Reichheld in \\ntwo recent books: The Loyalty Effect11 and The Quest for Loyalty.12 But as Reichheld \\nhimself argues: “Loyalty seems to be dying in our society. Look at the way we treat friendships, community organizations, even marriage. You would think we were \\nrenting cars or motel rooms instead of making commitments.” And, he points out, \\n“it’s not just our social lives that seem to be less permanent. As the Financial Times \\npointed out recently, business too seems to have entered the age of the one-night \\nstand.” The average US company, he notes: \\n \\n“now loses half its customers in five years, half its employees in four, and half \\nits investors in less than one. Layoffs, stock-market churn, fickle customers, \\nexecutive job surfing — all signs seem to point towards opportunism and disloyalty as the governing principles in commerce as well as in society.” \\n \\nBusiness leaders do not typically see loyalty, whether with suppliers, customers, \\nor other stakeholders, as fashionable, lucrative, or even particularly relevant. Their \\nview is that “they have more urgent problems to worry about — for example, \\ngrowth, productivity, and profits.” No one disputes that these priorities are indeed urgent, but the interesting thing about Reichheld’s work is that he argues that many \\nof the indicators of growth, productivity, and profitability seem to signal that the \\nwrong approach is being used. As Reichheld explains, “ignoring loyalty in order to focus on these ‘more pressing’ problems may be exactly the wrong fix.” \\nIn short, he argues, what is dead is the old form of unconditional loyalty. Fifty \\nyears ago, he suggests: \\n \\n“loyalty played a much larger part in everyday life than it does today. People \\nwere deeply loyal to their families, of course. But people also displayed unquestioning loyalty to a long list of civic, religious, and professional \\nauthorities and even to the companies they bought from and worked for.” \\n \\nAs a result, in today’s world “very few of us feel unconditional loyalty to anyone or \\nanything.” But don’t despair. Reichheld concludes that unconditional, hierarchical', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 245}),\n",

In fact, the same “zero defection” targets that Reichheld proposes for \\ncompanies wanting to be “loyalty leaders” can be cross-applied to broader stakeholder relationships. Companies may not be able to keep their customers, \\nemployees or triple bottom line stakeholders forever, but the greater the mutual, \\nearned respect and loyalty the greater is the chance that the organization will be sustainable. \\n \\nCo-opetition \\nWhen Barry Nalebuff and Adam Brandenburger chose “Business is War” as the first \\nphrase in their book Co-opetition , their intent was to skewer this notion.13 They \\naccept that the traditional language of business certainly makes it sound as though \\nbusiness is war: “outsmarting the competition, capturing market share, making a killing, fighting brands, beating up suppliers, locking up customers. Under business-\\nas-war, there are the victors and the vanquished.” But anyone involved in business \\ntoday knows that often it just isn’t like that. “You have to listen to customers, work with suppliers, create teams, establish strategic partnerships — even with \\ncompetitors. That doesn’t sound like war.” \\nAs they explain, the real business world often involves cooperation when \\ncreating a pie and competition when it comes to dividing it up. It’s not Tolstoy, with \\nendless cycles of war followed by peace followed by war. “It’s simultaneously war \\nand peace.” Or as Novell founder Ray Noorda put it: “You have to compete and cooperate at the same time.” Nalebuff and Brandenburger then use game theory to \\nwork out ways of avoiding “lose—lose” and “lose—win” outcomes, where everyone \\nloses or you set up the pie in such a way that only other people win, and instead pursue “win—win” outcomes. There is no reason at all why the same principles \\ncannot be pursued in relation to the “win—win—win” outcomes required by \\nsustainability’s triple bottom line. \\nSo if business is viewed as a game, who should we include as key players? The \\nanswer is customers, suppliers, competitors, and complementors  — those who \\nprovide complementary products, services, or other inputs. “Thinking complements', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 246}),\n",

To benefit from this insight, think about how to expand the pie by developing new complements or making existing \\ncomplements more affordable.” \\n \\nCo-opetition offers a number of rules for companies and stakeholders choosing \\nto travel this path. Simply stated, they are as follows: \\n \\n♦ Every player should be aware of the potential added value they bring to the \\ngame. How will the game be different if you are in rather than out? \\n♦ There needs to be at least a basic set of rules. Often, to build trust, these rules \\nneed to be spelled out and agreed early on. \\n♦ Perceptions need to be taken into account: different people view the world \\ndifferently. The way we see the game, and the way we think others see the game, influences the moves we make. \\n♦ There need to be boundaries: a game without boundaries gets too complex to \\nanalyze or play. Players need to agree on what those boundaries are or should be. \\n♦ Attention needs to be paid to different types of rationality and irrationality. In \\nany game, different players can be perfectly rational but, seeing the value added, rules, and boundaries in different ways, end up playing in very different ways. \\n \\nIn sustainability partnerships, as in all other walks of life, dismissing actual or \\npotential players as “irrational” closes the mind. It makes much more sense to \\nexpand the mind by trying to work out how others see the world, the game, and its \\nrules. “To us,” say Nalebuff and Brandenburger: \\n \\n“the issue of whether people are rational or irrational is largely beside the \\npoint. More important is remembering to look at a game from multiple perspectives — your own and that of every other player. This simple-sounding \\nidea is possibly the most profound insight of game theory.” \\n \\nIt is also one of the simplest, yet most effective ingredients in the expanded \\nstakeholder approach to capitalism.

Francis Fukuyama’s Trust,14 which I read \\non a flight to South Africa, had this effect on me. Best known for his 1992 best-\\nseller The End of History and the Last Man, Fukuyama (formerly deputy secretary \\nof the US State Department’s policy planning staff, then a Rand Corporation \\nanalyst) subsequently turned his attention to an area likely to be central to the \\nsustainable development agenda: trust — and what he describes as “social capital.” \\nWith capitalism increasingly in the ascendant around the world, The End of \\nHistory argued that different countries were coming to share increasingly similar \\npolitical and economic institutions. Now that the Cold War is considered to be over, Trust concludes that the most important issue facing Europe, the USA, and other \\nindustrial democracies is economic competitiveness. And here Fukuyama offers a \\nchilling conclusion: the tendency of countries like the USA and UK towards individualism will undermine their economies. By contrast, he argues, the success of \\nthe rapidly growing economies of East Asia is rooted in often overlooked forms of \\nsocial capital, such as trust, sense of community, and social integration. \\nFukuyama is hardly alone in making this case: The Economist pointed out that \\n“hardly an issue of the Harvard Business Review or the California Management \\nReview appears without the word ‘trust’ emblazoned on the cover.” One key reason \\nfor this is that many current trends in management, among them downsizing, \\nreengineering, and the culling of middle managers, are forcing companies to place \\nmore responsibility on, and faith in, their frontline employees. Now growing numbers of companies are finding that this internal need for trust is mirrored in the \\nexternal world. Just as they need to work much more closely with smaller numbers \\nof trusted suppliers, so they also feel the need to involve a growing range of external stakeholders, including sustainability campaigners, in setting their business \\npriorities. \\nIn conventional business terms, trust cuts the costs and delays involved in project \\ndevelopment and other processes.

That view will change. \\nA small but growing number of CEOs and other business leaders are waking up \\nto the need to involve even some of their fiercest critics in the process of deciding what their companies should do next. Listen to Monsanto CEO Bob Shapiro: \\n \\n“We have to reduce — and ultimately eliminate — the negative impacts we \\nhave on the world. But even if Monsanto reached its goal of zero impact next \\nTuesday, that wouldn’t solve the world’s problems. Several years ago, I \\nsensed that there was something more required of us than doing no harm, but I couldn’t articulate what it was.”\\n15 \\n \\nSo Shapiro pulled together a group of about 25 critical thinkers, including some \\nof the company’s up-and-coming leaders, and sent them off to ponder the issues \\nwith a number of non-traditional thinkers, including Paul Hawken, from the outside \\nworld. In short, this was a very focused form of partnership. “That off-site meeting in 1994 led to an emerging insight that we couldn’t ignore the changing global \\nenvironmental conditions,” recalls Shapiro: \\n \\n“The focus around sustainable development b ecame obvious. I s hould have \\nbeen able to come up with that in about 15 minutes. But it took a group of \\nvery good people quite a while to think it through, to determine what was real and what was just puff, and to convince themselves that this wasn’t a fluffy \\nissue — and that we ought to be engaged in it.” \\n \\nThe Monsanto people came away “emotionally fired up,” says Shapiro. “It wasn’t \\njust a matter of’ ‘Okay, you threw me an interesting business problem, I have', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 249}),\n",

This is important.’ ” \\nExperience suggests that such outcomes are much more likely when companies \\nbring the outside world in. Indeed, wherever we look, business is learning to listen to and consult with new types of stakeholder. As Cor Herkströter of Shell put it in the \\nwake of the Brent Spar and Nigerian controversies: \\n \\n“Naturally we have listened very closely to our customers. We have listened \\nvery carefully to government and to our staff. They, after all, were the \\ninstitutions, the bodies, we had always dealt with. Of course, we also dealt with environmentalist groups, consumer groups and so on, but we tended to \\nlet the public affairs department deal with them. They were important — but \\nthey were not as important as government, industry organizations and so on.”\\n16 \\n \\nThat, at least, was the prevailing wisdom, but these controversies signalled an \\nimportant shift in triple bottom line politics. “In essence,” Herkströter admits, “we \\nwere somewhat slow in understanding that these groups were tending to acquire \\nauthority. Meanwhile, those institutions we were used to dealing with were tending to lose authority. We underestimated the extent of these changes — we failed to \\nengage in a serious dialogue with these new groups.” The key message: “We learnt \\nwe had to be much more open to the world around us.”\\n17 \\nBubbling Under \\nGoing Dutch \\nSustainability partnerships can be initiated — and led — by government agencies, \\ncompanies, NGOs, or other stakeholders. One government-led partnership approach \\nwhich certainly ought to spread is based on “covenants,” or voluntary environmental agreements between business and government.

These have committed a wide range of sectors to meeting targets \\nin such areas as energy efficiency, greenhouse gas reduction, and the control of \\nvolatile organic compounds. So, for example, some 150 companies operating in the surface treatment sector signed up to an energy efficiency covenant with the \\neconomic affairs ministry which aimed for a 20% improvement between 1989 and \\n2000. And the approach, despite some NGO criticisms, appears to be making headway. When the chemicals covenant was reviewed, it turned out that 107 out of \\n125 companies committed to the agreement had already installed the management \\nsystems needed to monitor progress. \\nThe main criticisms have been that the covenants do not go far enough and, \\nbecause they tend to be based on intimate discussions between government and a \\nparticular sector, they are not as democratic as the traditional legislative processes. But there are also real advantages. As KPMG partner George Molenkamp put it: \\n \\n“From the government’s point of view, the covenant creates a wider base of \\nsupport from within industry. If the government tried to r each the same goals \\nthrough legislation, it would be time-consuming and not necessarily very \\neffective. Through voluntary agreement it is possible to do difficult things that could not easily be laid down in law.” \\n \\nThis approach, it hardly needs saying, is not applicable to all problems and all \\ncircumstances. To work, it not only requires sectoral bodies with the ability to \\nnegotiate agreements with governments, but also governments where the \\nfundamental policies and targets are not changed with every now administration. Above all, voluntary agreements will always require the pre-existence of a \\nreasonably comprehensive and sophisticated framework of legislation, to ensure that \\nany “free-riders” are identified and dealt with. \\n \\nEco-infrastructure \\nOne emerging recognition is that, however much a single company may be able to do on the eco-efficiency front, in the end sustainability will depend on the progress of entire concentrations of industry, complete value chains, and whole economies. \\nAs a result, we, see growing interest in the provision of eco-infrastructure, as for \\nexample in the concept of’ the eco-industrial park (EIP).

Most of these options translate into bottom line benefits to the companies.” \\n \\nOf course, as Tomorrow’s  US editor, Carl Frankel, put it: \\n \\n“There are many unknowns to contend with. Example: sooner or later a \\ncritical player in a multi-company waste recycling system will re-locate or go bankrupt. When that occurs, how do you keep the entire system from \\ncollapsing? More immediately, how do you reassure potential EIP participants \\nthat there isn’t a fatal design flaw? Another problem involves the difficulty of quantifying the economic and environmental benefits of EIPs for candidate \\ncompanies. The bottom line is that full-scale EIPs are still essentially \\nuntested.” \\n \\nFor participating companies, it also potentially adds one more level of uncertainty, \\nparticularly if they come to depend on the outputs of others nearby. \\nIn the Netherlands, meanwhile, there are plans for developing an “Environmental \\nTechnology Valley,” based on the Silicon Valley model and including at least one \\nbusiness park catering for up-and-coming eco-companies. And a series of proposed schemes have been surfacing across the USA.

The \\nManagement Institute for Environment and Business (MEB) has reviewed the \\nevolution of environmental partnerships in the USA, and defines four different types \\nof partnership. These are: preemptive  or resolution partnerships, which are designed \\nto defuse an already or potentially hostile situation; coalescing  partnerships, in \\nwhich rivals join forces to accomplish their goals; exploration partnerships, based on \\nopportunistic attempts to research or investigate issues of joint concern; and leverage  partnerships, whose aim is to find win—win (or win—win—win) \\nopportunities that will allow each party to make modest investments in return for \\nrelatively high gains.\\n21 The rules of the game will clearly vary depending on the \\nstyle of partnership adopted. \\nMost companies developing advanced eco-efficiency and sustainability \\nmanagement tools recognize that they need a multiplicity of inputs to the relevant processes if they are to provide robust suggestions for future product development \\nand marketing. But they also need to recognize that adopting the right tools and \\ndeveloping the relevant management systems is only part of the challenge. If they need to build public credibility and stakeholder engagement, and most companies \\ndo, they need to build wider partnerships — so that their stakeholders share a sense \\nof ownership in the approaches adopted. Given that different partners will bring different rationalities to the table, however, learning how to sustain these \\npartnerships will be a tough challenge. One outside possibility is that the unions — \\nincreasingly marginalized during much of the 1980s and 1990s — could find a new role as far-sighted brokers in relation to triple bottom line resources and \\nperformance. \\nThe losers, often, will be those left out of the really significant sustainability \\npartnerships. Sometimes this will be a result of the company’s perceived failures in \\nthe past, sometimes it may itself be a cause of subsequent business failure.

Now the telecommunications company Nortel is testing the “shared savings” \\napproach to chemicals use reduction in Canada and waste minimization in Britain.\\n22 \\nThe company, which is active in some 90 countries, employs more than 60,000 people, and had a turnover of US$10.7 billion in 1995, launched a Product Life \\nCycle Management program in 1992 designed to root out inefficiencies. \\nPartnerships with suppliers are seen to be fundamental to both commercial and \\nenvironmental success. Nortel’s shared savings approach focuses on the \\nrelationship between supplier and customer This is structured so as to provide both \\nwith financial incentives to improve their environmental performance, for example \\nby curbing resource consumption and waste generation. The new approach is badl y \\nneeded: recent trends in Nortel’s resource efficiency had been moving in the wrong \\ndirection. \\nIn 1993, the company disposed of 8,851 tonnes of solid waste to landfill in the \\nBritish Isles. Its target has beer to cut this figure by 50% by 2000, but by 1996 \\nlandfill disposals had jumped by 80% to 15,892 tonnes. Part of the problem had \\nbeen better reporting, but the pressure is now on to cut waste arisings dramatically. \\nInterestingly, however, the company found it hard to find suppliers able to meet its \\nnew needs. The waste industry proved to have little experience of shared savings contracts, but as growing numbers of customer companies move in this direction, \\nsuppliers and contractors will have no option but to work out new ways o\\nf \\npartnering with customers to boost efficiency — both in cost and environmental terms.

To help decide on the best way forward, it investigated how other long-established firms had addressed this \\nquestion.

The site contains 177 huge underground tanks of high-\\nlevel nuclear waste, at least a dozen tons of plutonium, five “gigantic and \\nprofoundly contaminated” buildings where plutonium was extracted fro m \\nirradiated nuclear fuel, and over 2,000 tons of irradiated fuel held in basins which, in an earthquake, “could become lethal, radioactive dustbins.” \\nHaving spent $7.5 billion in seven years on clean-up, DOE expects to spend \\nof least $1 billion a year at Hanford for the next 40 years. But huge though Hanford is, it only accounts for about a fifth of a DOE programme to close dow\\nn \\na large part of its nuclear weapons enterprise over the next century, give or take \\na decade or two. Estimates of the clean-up costs range from $230 billion to more than half a trillion dollars — well in excess of the $375 billion, in current dollars, \\nthat it cost the US to research and build tens of thousands of weapons, and to \\ndetonate the 1000 or so tested. \\n‘The stuff we’re dealing with can’t go away until it decays,” said James D. \\nWerner, director of strategic planning in the DOE’s Office of Environmental \\nManagement.

They wanted to measure the effect of various soil \\ntreatments on crop yields, from applying nothing at all through to full dollops o f \\nartificial fertilizer. As the Financial Times  put it, Lawes and Gilbert had little \\nidea of what they had begun, but “these remarkable trials illuminate \\ncontemporary debate about the long-term effects of intensive food production, the limits of bio-diversity and the impact of global warming.”\\n20 \\nLawes was an entrepreneur who produced synthetic fertilizer by grinding \\nanimal bones, then treating them with sulphuric acid at his 16th century mano r \\nhouse. The profits he made from the resulting “super-phosphate of lime” helped \\nfound the Rothamsted Experimental Station, a leading UK agricultural research \\ninstitute, and start large-scale crop trials. One area collapsed after a century o f \\nnitrogen fertilizer treatment, which had allowed a fungus to build up and ravage \\nturnip crops. “Today we may be starting farming systems which may take \\nequally long to collapse,” warned Rothamsted’s leading expert on the experiments. \\nIn 1882, another area was simply abandoned to see what happened. \\nA \\ncentury later, it become critically important when the agricultural industry bega n \\nto wonder what would happen if large areas of farming land were retired — o r \\n“set aside” — for conservation purposes. \\nA side-benefit of the trials was that a system of drains under each plot has \\nallowed scientists to monitor inputs of pollutants from other sources. \\nAstonishingly, just 10 years after the first PCBs were produced in the US during \\nthe late 1930s, they were detected in Rothamsted soils — having traveled across the Atlantic in the atmosphere.

Evolutionary biologists, waking up to the fact that evolution is \\nrarely a straight-line progression, talk of’ “punctuated equilibrium” — in which \\ndramatic environmental changes trigger huge evolutionary jumps in relatively short time-scales.

Alternatively, the “challenge and response” plot might suggest a series of interlocking trends leading towards an “ec oboom.” “This \\nlate in the game,” as Schwartz put it: \\n \\n“the urgency of building a ‘sustainable growth’ society would inspire unusual \\ninnovation and change.

Take the \\ncase of Englishman Ian Johnston, who inherited Thortergill Gorge in 1971. Along with the site, which his ancestors had sold for mining in the 1780s as too steep for \\nfarming, Johnston also felt he had inherited a “debt to Nature,” which he was \\ndetermined to repay.\\n25 By the time the mine established on the site closed in the \\n1920s, the valley, with its streams and waterfalls, had been buried under thousands \\nof tons of rock and spoil. Over a period of a quarter century, Johnston and his family \\nhave restored the Gorge, even selling their industrial supplies distribution business in order to fund the work. \\nBy the standards of today, such behavior is little short of madness. Johnston may \\nhave been awarded a pewter plate by Country Life , as the magazine’s “Countryman \\nof the Year,” but any head-hunter scouting for directors to help companies build a \\ncompetitive position well into the 21st century would probably have given him a \\nwide berth. However, there are elements of both these stories which reflect a different logic, a different understanding of time and the opportunities and \\nresponsibilities that long time can bring. If we managed to get at least part of the \\nworld onto the tracks leading to a more sustainable future, Son and Johnston might find themselves being courted as business visionaries.

Some cultures view \\ntime as sequential. always running out. Others view time as circular, with the present \\nfeeding back rich experience to help us improve our chances of benefiting from tomorrow’s inevitable opportunities. The implications of the two different \\napproaches are profound. \\nCountries like the USA, the UK, Sweden and the Netherlands seem more \\noriented to sequential time, focusing on speeding things up. According to Hampden-\\nTurner and Trompenaars, Japan, Germany, and France tend to be more interested in \\nsynchronized, parallel time. The results of these differences can be seen in how companies view their own people: in a “sequential culture, a “rationalizing” \\ncompany will tend to see employees as a cost and waste, whereas in a synchronous \\nculture they are more likely to be seen as a potential resource for the future, worth training and investing in. \\nIn the sequential culture, time is an enemy, “an implacably hastening and \\nexpensive train of events that must be used fully” and products are seen as “maturing over time, going from high novelty and profitability to routine operations, lower \\nmargins, and eventual death.” By contrast, in synchronizing cultures, time is a friend \\n“who keeps coming around, providing fresh opportunities for engagement on each occasion” and products tend to be regarded as “self-renewing over time, the ‘genes’ \\nof one product giving life to the next generation and the next.” \\nAsked to plot the past, present, and future as three circles of varying sizes and \\nproximities on a line, thousands of executives around the world demonstrated the \\nvery different ways in which they experienced time. Probably the most dramatic \\ndifference was between France (where the past loomed largest, the present much smaller, and the future much smaller again) and Japan (where the experience of time \\nwas most unified or telescoped, with the past smallest, the present medium-sized, \\nand the future largest). In the USA, there was the largest gap between the past and the present, with the present strongly overlapping with the future.

As activist Jeremy \\nRifkin put it: “Balancing our budget with nature requires that we reorient the pace of \\nour economic activity so that it is compatible with nature’s timetables.”29 Nor is it \\nsimply a question of different cultures having different time perceptions: even \\nindividuals living and working in the same culture may have very different \\nperceptions of time — as, indeed, may the same individual at different stages in his or her life. Organizations, too, can create their own time environments.

Pierre Wack, one \\nof the architects of Shell’s scenario planning system, published two seminal papers in the Harvard Business Review during 1985 outlining “one thing or two learned \\nwhile developing planning scenarios for Royal Dutch/Shell.”\\n34 Scenarios, Wack \\nargued, deal not only with the hard facts of the “outer space” beyond the organization but with the softer, fluid perceptual “inner space” of people’s minds. At \\nthe time, he had in mind the necessity to bridge these two realms in such a way that \\nShell managers experienced a creative insight that generated a heartfelt “Aha!” as new strategic insights emerged. But effective scenarios must also capture what is \\ngoing on in the inner space of the public  mind. \\nWhen Shell pulled the two articles together to form the first in its “Strategic \\nPlanning in Shell” papers in 1986, the slim blue-covered document was entitled The \\nGentle Art of Re-perceiving. There were three key insights. First, during a time of \\nrapid change, companies differ greatly in their effectiveness and speed in identifying and transforming information of strategic significance into strategic initiatives. \\nSecond, the sheer amount of “noise,” caused by all the conflicting signals to which \\nwe are all exposed, infinitely complicates the task of choosing the right responses. Locked into traditional perceptions, governments and companies alike can suffer \\nstrategic failure. The third insight addressed the question of what can be done to \\naddress these two problems. The answer stems from the fact that the human brain is much better at discriminating significant trends from the noise when it is listening \\nfor something — or for one of several things. Hence the value of scenarios sketching \\nout evolving realities. \\nThe Brent Spar controversy suggests that failures in this “gentle art” will \\ncontinue to result in ungentle, highly bruising controversies which force the business \\nworld to re-perceive the emerging environmental agenda in public.\\n35 Globe-\\nstraddling Shell is well placed to recognize the growing worldwide concern that \\ncurrent patterns of development are unsustainable. But it may have made the mistake \\nof assuming that the environmental debate is now focused on pragmatic questions of efficiency rather than on more fundamental concerns linked to a growing aversion to \\nenvironmental risk. \\nNot that the use of scenarios ever guarantees the “right” outcome.

This problem is likely to be \\neven more complicated where the issue cuts across international borders. In the case \\nof the Brent Spar, Shell UK might have weathered the storm, but its sister \\ncompanies operating in more environmentally sensitive European countries, particularly Deutsche Shell, were much harder hit. \\nIt is also becoming clear that environmental issues cannot be considered in \\nisolation from an increasingly interconnected, competitive, and fast-moving global economy. The result is a business world marked by growing complexity, drawn-out \\ntime-scales for action, and a growing number of unpleasant surprises. \\n \\nManaging Complexity \\nTo survive, let alone succeed, in an increasingly complex world, companies and \\ninstitutions will need to develop strategies which provide clear, integrated \\nframeworks for action, yet which are sufficiently resilient and flexible to cope with the unexpected. Indeed, as the concept of sustainability becomes part of mainstream \\npolitical discourse, so we also see a growing recognition that the challenge is \\ncompounded by its increasing complexity. “Complexity,” of course, is another buzzword whose fortunes have oscillated fairly dramatically. What is clear, \\nhowever, is that economic, technological, social, and environmental change is \\naccelerating, placing new demands on decision-makers in business and government. It is also increasingly obvious that today’s decision making, modelling, and analysis \\ntools, and the theoretical frameworks on which they are based, are proving to be \\nincreasingly inadequate. \\nTo help business people, and their various complementors, to understand and \\nrespond to the emerging trends, Alex Trisoglio, SustainAbility. and a range of \\npartners developed a set of three scenarios of a sustainable Europe in 2020 for two clients: European Partners for the Environment (EPE)\\n36 and the Commission for the \\nEuropean Communities (CEC).37 Our conclusion was that Shell’s scenarios to date \\nhad been “individualist,” “hierarchist,” or some combination of the two. None had adopted an egalitarian or “values shift” perspective. We also argued that the “values \\nshift” scenario — one of the seemingly more outlandish scenarios developed for \\nEuropean Partners for the Environment (EPE)—holds clues to necessary future shifts in business strategy.\\n38 \\nIn analyzing the scenarios published up to 1995 by Shell and its key scenario \\nplanners (among them Peter Schwartz), Alex Trisoglio used the three categories developed by cultural theory.\\n39 These three ways of life and their associated \\nrationalities may be summarized by three archetypal examples: ', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 281}),\n",

It assumes that many of the \\nenvironmental concerns of recent decades have been greatly exaggerated. \\nEcosystems, and economies, have proved very much more adaptable than had been expected. Technological progress has been rapid and economic growth \\nbased on novel information technologies, biotechnology, and new materials has \\ngenerated the wealth to pay for the sustainability transition. Market mechanisms are pre-eminent, the information society is reducing human impacts on the \\nenvironment, and sustainability is seen in terms of securing a rising standard o\\nf \\nliving and quality of life through technological progress.  \\nScenario 2: ORDERLY TRANSITION \\nORDERLY TRANSITION is the hierarchist scenario. It is based on the idea tha\\nt \\nthe challenge of integrating environment and economy is manageable within the \\nexisting paradigm, but assumes a need for a government-led response based o n \\nstrong, integrated economic and environmental policies. The internalization o f \\nexternal costs is achieved by ecological tax reform.

But, be warned, pick the wrong scenarios and you can be blinded to the new realities emerging around you. \\n♦ Third, to ensure a switch from extractive to restorative modes of operation \\n(see Chapter 13), society needs to work out ways of representing the needs of future generations in today’s decision making. Our political institutions, \\ncompany boards, and other decision-making systems must learn to recruit \\nand listen to “time guardians.” \\n \\nNotes \\n \\n1.

The best way to ensure that a given company fully addresses the triple \\nbottom line is to build the relevant requirements into its corporate DNA from the \\nvery outset and into the parameters of the markets it seeks to serve. \\nThis challenge always intensifies as the world economy goes through one of its \\nregular frenzies of mergers or demergers. In a globalizing economy, the pressure to \\nmerge can only grow. At the same time, however, many of the conglomerates resulting from previous outbreaks of the “urge to merge” now look ripe for break-up. \\nThe authors of Break Up!  argue that some parts of the world now face a period of \\ndemerger as intense as the conglomeration trend was in the sixties and early seventies.\\n1 Whichever way the scales tip, the inevitable restructurings pose major \\nchallenges for those trying to build triple bottom line thinking into the affected \\ncompanies. \\nTraditionally, corporate governance has focused on the ways in which \\norganizations, particularly limited companies, are managed, and on the nature of the \\naccountability of managers to owners. In the UK, the debate was given a big push in 1992 when the Cadbury Report introduced a code of practice which the UK Stock \\nExchange now requires listed companies to report against. Similar initiatives have \\nbeen surfacing in other industrialized countries. Those who work in the field will probably resist the expansion of the corporate governance agenda to cover corporate \\naccountability to a wider range of stakeholders, but that expansion now seems \\ninevitable. \\nAnother reason why corporate governance and the role of boards will be under \\nthe spotlight is that campaigners now recognize how shallow their hold on the \\ncorporate psyche often is. Indeed, the weakness of the corporate world’s support for the sustainability agenda became abundantly clear in 1994, when the Republican \\nParty gained control of the US Congress for the first time in forty years.

German president \\nRoman Herzog summed up the mood of resentment when he noted that “job losses have become evidence of managerial success; social duty has been sacrificed to \\nprofits.” Business ethics professor Karl Homann concurred: “Competition is the \\nbasis of a modern economy,” he said. “But it makes moral behavior difficult for the individual.” \\nAnd the country’s belief in the new spirit of enterprise also took a hammering \\nwhen teenage tycoon Lars Windhorst, hailed as Germany’s answer to Bill Gates and advanced by Chancellor Helmut Kohl as a role model for German youth, turned out \\nto have feet of clay. “This is a boy who believes in the future, who believes in \\nhimself,” Kohl had said. “That’s exactly what I want, that 18- and 19-year-olds should take a risk and go out into the world instead of calculating their pensions.”\\n5 \\nBut, when the prosecutors announced that they were investigating Windhorst for possible misrepresentation, what was described as a “capitalist fairy tale” began to unravel. \\n \\nAltars of the Short Term \\nNone of this means that capitalism is intrinsically “wrong” or “bad.” But the \\nevidence that capitalism needs firm, long-sighted triple bottom line management is \\ngrowing ever stronger.

In fact, he has a much higher \\nopinion of the ability of corporate boards to take over the world than to run it once in \\ncontrol. \\nJonathan Charkham, on the other hand, is much more optimistic. “The way \\nbusiness is run matters to us all, wherever we live,” he argues in Keeping Good \\nCompany ,\\n12 a fascinating and fairly upbeat study of corporate governance in five \\ncountries. Formerly an adviser to the Governor of the Bank of England and a \\nmember of the UK Cadbury Committee, Charkham had a more than academic \\ninterest in the subject. \\n“The subject of corporate governance has attracted increasing attention on both \\nsides of the Atlantic in recent years,” he points out: \\n \\n“for good reasons. Every country wants the firms that operate within its \\nborders to flourish and grow in such a way as to provide employment, wealth, \\nand satisfaction, not only to improve standards of living materially but also to enhance social cohesion. These aspirations cannot be met unless those firms \\nare competitive internationally in a sustained way, and it is this medium- and \\nlong-term perspective that makes good corporate governance so vital.” \\n \\nThese issues are becoming ever more important as the international markets \\nbecome increasingly competitive, as the “the economies of the Far East gather speed and the former Communist states enter the fray.” In this new world, Charkham \\ninsists, countries “will need to take a long hard look at the way other systems work \\nand keep their own under review; to tolerate a poor system is to impose upon oneself an unnecessary competitive handicap.” \\nThe need for appropriate systems of corporate governance is not now in dispute \\n— nor is the role of governments in establishing the relevant rules. “Everywhere the company or corporation is a creature of statute not nature,” Charkham notes: \\n \\n“designed to encourage the agglomeration and continuity of power that the \\nsophistication of modern economies requires.

It is not government’s duty \\nto double-guess individual commercial decisions — but to ensure as best it \\ncan that the structure it creates for companies contains checks and balances that are effective in resolving the tensions between differing legitimate \\nclaims.” \\n \\nIn a world where many corporations are richer and more powerful than many \\nsovereign states, the challenge for governance systems is “to give power to those \\nbest able to use it — and to remove it from those who use it poorly or evilly.” Charkham underscores the fact that many of those running corporations are not so \\nmuch the current versions of yesterday’s pirates as the heirs of those who built great \\ncathedrals and other creations and enterprises that have lasted down the centuries. There is plenty of evidence, he says, “that the men and women in business are not \\ndedicated just to getting the most for the least personal effort. Many are by nature \\nand instinct builders who invest themselves in their enterprises and may well in some cases continue to do so long after their economic needs have been satisfied.” \\nSo, by implication, the better the system of governance, the greater the chance \\nthat we can build towards genuinely sustainable capitalism. The purpose of governance systems is to help companies draw on the constructive vitality of their \\npeople, while containing the effects of their inevitable weaknesses. Even the most \\ntalented business people cannot sustain the highest quality of decision-making forever. \\nThe key tests of a system of governance, Charkham suggests, revolve around \\nquestions on such issues as dynamism and accountability. First, then, does the system “permit the management of an enterprise to drive it forward without undue \\nfear of governmental interference, litigation, or displacement?” And, second, does \\nthe system: \\n \\n“ensure that in exercising its freedom management is effectively accountable \\nfor its decisions and actions so that the necessary standards are maintained and the appropriate remedial action can be taken in a timely way if they are not?” \\n \\nCharkham accepts that there is a case for a third criterion, focusing on a \\ncompany’s “social” performance. But he argues that in a competitive market \\neconomy, however imperfect it may be, companies find it: \\n \\n“difficult to sustain success over time, and society is best served when \\ncompanies concentrate on that and not other causes, however desirable in \\nthemselves, because the social consequences of failure are not costless.', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 299}),\n",

The challenge for national governments and \\ninternational government agencies will be to evolve corporate governance systems \\nthat help — rather than hinder — them in this task. \\n \\nRotting from the Head \\nSome board-level problems flow from what seems to be a profound misconception of what it is that boards are intended to do. How, for example, does the average company board see its position within the company? The answer, typically, is as the \\napex of a pyramid — with the main focus on internal affairs. The result, as Bob \\nGarratt argues in The Fish Rots from the Head ,\\n13 is that directors: \\n \\n“have an understandable, but not forgivable, inclination to find any excuse to \\nintervene in the managerial system as soon as they see a crisis occurring, or to create a crisis themselves so that they can continue to demonstrate their \\nmanagerial prowess.” \\n \\nInstead, Garratt insists, the role of a direction-giver is to apply a “brain-on” rather \\nthan a “hands-on” attitude. \\nThis is more than just word-play. A fundamental shift in the board-level mind-set \\nis required. Directors need to see themselves not at the apex of a pyramid but as part \\nof the “business brain” or “central processing unit” of the company. Their role is to \\ndevelop, monitor, and cope with the results of the company’s internal and external \\nlearning processes. Furthermore, directors “need to create the political, strategic and \\nemotional environment” for change, giving “their highest priority to ensuring that \\ntheir organization is supported in its energy niches, or can migrate to new ones so that it can continue to survive and grow.” As part of this task, they need to develop \\nand communicate clear, credible visions of where the company is bound. \\nIn fulfilling their role, Garratt suggests that directors need to address four \\n“directorial dilemmas,” each and all of which can be cross-applied to the task of \\ntackling the sustainability agenda.

The ways in which each type of board will handle the \\nsustainability agenda will be somewhat different, although the basic tasks are the \\nsame.

Directors who Ross Perot \\nhad once described as Stempel’s “pet rocks” became a force to be reckoned with, a \\ntrend. repeated in different parts of the world. As the experience of companies like GM and Saatchi & Saatchi suggested, the days when boards simply approved what \\nmanagement was already doing are clearly on the wane. \\nCompanies like Gm had been exposed to shareholder activism since the 1960s, \\non a growing range of social issues. Indeed, GM broke new ground in 1971 by \\nappointing the Reverend Leon Sullivan, a black civil rights leader, to its board. He \\nwas an effective director and drafted the Sullivan Principles for corporate dealings with South Africa, a code widely adopted by other companies. During the next \\nquarter of a century, as Ward recalls, pension fund activism tended to be associated \\nwith “liberal causes, social protest, and annual meeting gadflies who droned on until the other shareholders were ready to start throwing their chairs.” Getting such \\nactivists to support consistent evolution in the broad range of board policies was \\n“like trying to herd cats.” \\nIn the wake of the Exxon Valdez disaster,  we saw the launch of the Valdez \\nPrinciples, develped by the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies \\n(CERES). Later re-named the CERES Principles, these became a key influence on the debate, spurring the International Chamber of Commerce — which found itself \\nunable to swallow the CERES Principles whole — to develop its own Business \\nCharter for Sustainable Development. The CERES Coalition itself is composed of an unusual mix of campaigners and ethical investors, and now has companies such \\nas Sun Oil and General Motors reporting according to the CERES model. \\nThe next wave of investor activism, headed by enormous investment groups such \\nas CalPERS, saw a rather different approach. In 1987, CalPERS (California Public \\nEmployee Retirement System) began to compile, and later publicize, a top 10 listing \\nof “underperforming” companies. These were held to be lagging behind peer firms  \\nin shareholder return and in their willingness to go along with emerging governance  \\nreforms. By the mid-1990s, some activists were beginning to complain that funds \\nlike CalPERS were, to  quote Ralph Nader, “going quiescent.” But Ward has a \\ndifferent view: “Better to say that those who once had to shout to be heard now need \\nonly whisper.” ', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 305}),\n",

In these cases, the committee will also tie in broader green \\nconcerns, such as liaison with major environmental groups and monitoring of \\nenvironment-related issues and how they will affect the business.” \\n \\nWard sees some of these practices as very likely to spread to Europe, while a \\nrange of issues and approaches that have emerged in Europe (for example, take-back legislation and design for disassembly) are flowing the other way. These new green \\nlaws will be of concern to any US board doing business in Europe,” he predicts. \\n“Beyond that, expect them to pop up on the US agenda sooner rather than later.” \\nThe growing focus on board effectiveness and efficiency can only build further. \\nIn the process, boards will find themselves called upon to broaden their horizons. \\n“Laws on the environment, equal opportunity, restraint of trade, and labor relations are among those that force boards to trade off short-term shareholder value for \\nlonger-term social good,” Ward notes. “Yet without the single, overriding goals of \\nshareholder value, the board loses its North Star to steer by.” This is why we see a growing interest in concepts like environmental shareholder value (see Case Study, \\np.293) and the market benefits of improved stakeholder relationships. \\nBoardroom Views \\nRiders on the Storm \\nDespite evidence to the contrary, many chairmen and CEOs of major companies \\nmay feel that they can ride out virtually any storm, and for a number of reasons.

In the process, the company will need to “integrate \\nenvironmental imperatives into management strategy, and into the thousands o\\nf \\ndecisions that all our employees make.”16 \\nTo spur the process, Electrolux is one of the companies that has been trialling \\nthe life-cycle philosophy and systems approach advanced by The Natural Step Foundation.

Already, the management response, particularly in the field of stakeholder engagement, has been evolving for well over half a century. Nor has it always gone \\nin a straight line.

The answer is that — unless they happen to be sitting on a goldmine or have developed a technology or market which enables \\nthem to do whatever they please — most companies will find the financial markets a \\nmajor constraint for years to come. Indeed, many directors who deal direct with investors and analysts will continue to have every reason to believe that the capitalist \\nsystem demands macho strategies.

Later, the idea expanded, embracing the notio n \\nthat stakeholders should have more of a sense of participation in the day-to-day \\naffairs of the corporation. So we saw consumer advisory panels, quality circles, just-in-time inventory teams, community advisory groups, and so on.\\n24 \\nDuring the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a surge of interest i n \\nbusiness ethics. Much of the discussion focused on perceived corporate excesses, including industrial disasters, “fat cat” pay rises, business—governmen\\nt \\ncollusion and so on. But, recalls R. Edwards Freeman, director of the Universit y \\nof Virginia’s Olsson Center of Applied Ethics: \\n \\n“a small number of thinkers began to ask questions about the very purpose \\nof the corporation. Should the corporation serve those who own shares of stock or should if serve those who are affected by its actions?

Most business people know that businesses canno t \\nbe built and sustained simply by obsessive attention to improving shareholde r \\nvalue. Clearly, shareholder value is critical: without it, a company would no t \\nhave access to the capital needed to create wealth. But any modern product, fro m \\ntoilet paper to a Boeing 777, comes to us thanks to people working with a wide range of stakeholders to bring that product successfully to market. The real issue \\nis not whether stakeholders should be involved; they are, many whether they like \\nit or not. instead, the issue, and the emerging challenge, is how to balance the interests of different groups in pursuit of triple bottom line performance. \\nWhere key stakeholders are ignored, they will use the political process to \\nforce new regulations, standards and other forms of control. This has been true of such areas as labor, health and safety, consumer and environmental \\nprotection, and even shareholder protection regulation.

This is the aspect of \\nthe challenge that is currently taxing companies like Electrolux (Case Study, p.293). \\nBut their very interest in this area is likely to be one of the factors that helps wake up \\nsome of the leading financial institutions and encourages them to develop the necessary tools for analyzing the shareholder value associated with good, indifferent, \\nand poor triple bottom line performance in different sectors, markets, and world \\nregions. \\nThree Keys to the 21st Century \\nThe seventh sustainability revolution focuses on corporate governance, requiring \\nthat we understand and use the following keys to sustainable enterprise: \\n ♦ First, the sustainability agenda will often overlap the corporate governance \\nagenda. High performance boards are critical to the sustainability transition. \\nMore attention needs to be paid to the role of boards and directors in monitoring, understanding, prioritizing and ensuring progress towards \\nsustainability targets. \\n♦ Second, the evolution of new forms of stakeholder capitalism will require \\ncompanies to develop much more “inclusive” ways of handling stakeholder \\ndialog, focused on multi-way dialog not simply one-way information flows \\nfrom the company. One option is to conduct a sustainability audit along the lines sketched out in Chapter 14 — and ask key stakeholders to help in the \\nprocess. \\n♦ Third, the membership of any board will increasingly need to reflect the \\ndiversity and time-scales of the sustainability challenge. A key question, \\ngiven such board-level diversity, is how can companies sustain their unity of \\npurpose? Part of the answer must be by the development of shared visions and targets, and by the creation of organizations that genuinely learn and \\nevolve at a competitive pace. \\n \\nNotes \\n \\n1.

The “sustainable corporation” will undergo similar \\ntransmutations, but soon we will see thousands of new businesses signing up for sustainability — and pushing towards zero. Zero defects, zero waste, zero pollution, \\nand, longer term, zero ethical stumbles. \\nOur collective giant leap towards sustainability is starting with small corporate \\nsteps. But even small steps can be nerve-wracking. I recall when BP executives \\nunveiled three different versions of a new health, safety, and environment policy \\nstatement and asked a group of thirty or so stakeholders which version they preferred. Most of us had no problem in making the choice. We liked the ultra-short \\nversion, whose second line ran, “Our goals are simply stated — no accidents, no \\nharm to people, and no damage to the environment.” Not surprisingly, BP wondered whether such extraordinary goals would seem credible for a giant oil company, but \\nour answer was clear. We know companies like BP have no hope of reaching zero \\nimpact targets any time soon, but sustainable development will depend on their willingness to set tough “stretch” goals and then, year after year, to strain towards \\nthem. \\nCompanies like this, even those with a deep understanding of the triple bottom \\nline agenda, would be very wary of using the phrase “sustainable corporation.” \\nApart from anything else, the concept, while it may sound desirable, is still \\nenormously hazy.

What will be \\nthe balance between compliance pressures and business opportunities in driving its \\nevolution? And to what extent will markets need to be restructured to drive and \\nsupport the process? \\nThe answers are still in the process of forming. But one of my most powerful \\nlearning experiences along that path happened years ago in San Diego. The images \\nare still unusually clear in my mind. Outside, lines of pelicans skimmed the surf line, threading between the surfers. Inside the cliff-top hotel, on the southern Californian \\ncoastline, I was talking to Richard (Dick) Mahoney, CEO of one of America’s \\nlargest chemical corporations. This was 1992, year of the UN Earth Summit. The occasion was a meeting on the “sustainable corporation.” The starting-point of our \\nconversation: the corporate impact of the Bhopal disaster. \\nIn the wake of Union Carbide’s horrific upset in India, Mahoney had sent health, \\nsafety, and environmental auditing teams around the world and had committed \\nMonsanto to massively reduce its toxic emissions. Sitting high above the Pacific \\nbreakers, he now recalled the reaction of his board when, in the wake of legislation requiring companies to report their emissions and the publication of the so-called \\n“Monsanto Pledge,” it received the first discharge data. Total shock. Nor was this \\nsimply environmental concern: the numbers showed extraordinary quantities of product  escaping into the environment. \\nNow, however, we are seeing the beginning of a shift from pollution control to \\nsustainable development. Bob Shapiro’s article in the Harvard Business Review \\nsignalled a profound shift in the company’s thinking, from pollution prevention to \\nsustainable development. “Businesses grounded in the old model will become \\nobsolete and die,” Shapiro predicted: \\n \\n“At Monsanto we’re trying to invent some new businesses around the concept \\nof environmental sustainability. We may not know exactly what those businesses will look like, but we’re willing to place some bets because the \\nworld cannot avoid needing sustainability in the long run.” \\n \\nThe company had launched seven sustainability teams. Number 1 focuses on \\neco-efficiency, working closely with suppliers and customers. Number 2 works on \\nfull-cost accounting, developing a methodology for assessing the total cost of making, using, and disposing of products. Number 3 is building an index to check \\nprogress towards sustainability. Number 4 is looking at new products and new \\nbusiness opportunities. Number 5 focuses on water and Number 6 on global hunger.

This is about us. What do we \\nwant to do? Companies aren’t machines anymore. We have thousands of \\nindependent agents trying to self-coordinate because it is in their interest to do so.” \\n \\nMore fundamentally still, he suggests that, “working on sustainability offers huge hope for healing the rift between our economic activity and our total human activity. \\nInstead of seeing the two in Marxist opposition, we see them as the same thing.” \\nAnother reason why that 1992 meeting stands out in my memory is that this was \\nthe first time I came across Tom Gladwin. Torn had written the main document first \\nthe Synergy ‘92 conference, where Mahoney and I had also been speakers. The title \\nof the report, commissioned by the National Wildlife Federation’s Corporate Conservation Council, was Building the Sustainable Corporation.\\n1 It provided a \\nhuge stimulus to the thinking outlined in C annibals With Forks . \\nThe 1990s saw a growing range of powerful interests moving into this field. For \\nexample, among Synergy ‘92’s other sponsors were the International Environmental \\nBureau (IEB), part of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), and the \\nBusiness Council for Sustainable Development (BCSD). Later, these two organizations merged to form the World Business Council for Sustainable \\nDevelopment (WBCSD). And what was interesting was that these different consortia \\nof proactive corporations were all coming to the same conclusion: business must play a central, even leading, role in shifting the world on to the sustainable \\ndevelopment path. \\nAlthough I criticized In Search of Excellence in the early 1980s because of its \\nfailure to make a single mention of the environmental agenda, by 1991 Tom Peters \\nwas publishing Lean, Green and Clean (see Spotlight, pp. 32–3), and arguing that by \\nthe year 2000 the world’s most successful corporations would be those that got to the market “firstest with the mostest,” having incorporated environmental efficiency \\nthroughout their value chains.\\n2 But, as we have seen, there is a big difference', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 322}),\n",

When he was head of the environmental department at the Czech company Synthesia, his job, in the words of the Wall  Street Journal Europe , \\nwas, “akin to being paid to bang your head against the wall.”\\n3 The reason was that \\nunder the Communist regime the cornerstone of state policy was to deny there were any environmental problem. “The acrid chemical stench and thick brown haze that \\nenvelop the plant and its surroundings for many kilometers bear bitter witness to the \\npast policy of neglect,” the Journal  reported. \\nBut Valousek’s persistence was rewarded: he became a director of Synthesia as \\nthe company went through the process of privatization. The company has been \\ndeveloping plans for massive environmental clean-up projects and rebuilding relations with employees and local communities. Indeed, the Czech Business \\nLeaders Forum, an affiliate of The Prince of Wales Business Leaders Forum, \\ndecided that the chemical company’s achievements were worthy of recognition with an award. And at that point Synthesia’s prize product became public knowledge in \\nthe West. This is Semtex, the explosive which has been terrorists’ weapon of choice \\nfor years. It was used to blow Pan Am flight 103 out of the skies over Lockerbie, Scotland, and to attack a wide range of civilian and military targets. \\nA spokesman for the Prince of Wales Business Leaders Forum explained: \\n \\n“The reason for the prize is purely environmental. The company has \\ndemonstrated it has made excellent environmental progress. They have \\ncompletely cleaned up their act. What its products are used for and where they go does not form part of the Forum’s remit.”\\n4 \\n \\nWell, fine, but it is not hard to see why the controversy erupted. \\nAs the communist world imploded, the terrorism link had proved to be a major \\nproblem for Synthesia when it had to begin raising funds on international capital \\nmarkets. Given that explosives are needed for a wide range of legitimate uses, the company clearly had to work out a way of dealing with the terrorist problem.

As \\na result, the Semtex the company has made since 1991 can be detected at airports \\nand other vulnerable sites by trained dogs and detection equipment. \\nThe underlying message from the Synthesia experience is that eco-efficiency is \\nnever going to be enough to ensure acceptable triple bottom line performance. \\nWherever in the world they are based or operate, growing numbers of corporations \\nare finding that even world class eco-efficiency standards are no guarantee of a safe ride. \\nTake Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), the Swiss-based engineering group that came \\nunder attack when it got involved in plans to build massive dam projects in Malaysia and China. Although ABB executives argued that it is better that such \\nenvironmentally sensitive projects be carried out by companies dedicated to \\nsustainability, the proposed Ba kun Dam scheme came under challenge across the \\nfull spectrum of triple bottom line issues. \\nOn the economic front, even members of ABB’s own environmental advisory \\nboard, including Stephan Schrnidheiny, said that they would have preferred to have seen Malaysia calling upon the company’s expertise in energy efficiency.\\n5 On the \\nenvironmental front, it was estimated that some 700 square kilometres of rainforest, \\nan area the size of Singapore, would be flooded. And on the social front, perhaps most controversially of all, some 10,000 local people would need to be relocated to \\nmake way for the new reservoir. \\nWidely regarded as one of the founders of corporate environmentalism, ABB’s \\nenvironmental policy commits it to “promoting sustainable development.” Now it \\nfound itself in the excruciating position of being targeted by over 100 NGOs and \\naccused of “dumping outdated technology.” The Bakun Dam controversy was important, noted Martin Wright, one of Tomorrow’s  editors, “because in its choppy \\nwaters are thrown together some of the essential tangles of sustainable development: \\nhow to ensure adequate energy supplies for booming economies; how transnational companies square the pursuit of lucrative contracts with a corporate commitment to \\nenvironmental responsibility; how such companies address the growing demands to \\nextend this responsibility to social justice and human rights issues; and how to decide where, if at all, the burden of responsibility shifts irrevocably from company \\nto government.”\\n6 \\nThirty-nine Steps to Sustainability \\nSo how should business leaders and their corporations respond to the seven \\nsustainability revolutions?

Take Japan, for \\nexample, where the country’s largest stockbroker, Nomura Securities, admitted that it had been paying off the local version of the Mafia.\\n8 The bribes are designed to \\nensure that difficult questions are not asked at annual shareholders’ meetings, which \\ntend to proceed at warp speed in an attempt to ensure that top executives are not embarrassed. Hardly a conducive atmosphere for open discussions about a \\ncompany’s triple bottom line responsibilities and performance. \\nBut a new business paradigm is emerging. Listen to John Baker, speaking as \\nchairman of Britain’s largest power company, National Power plc, and of the World \\nEnergy Council: \\n \\n“The last 10 years have seen a remarkable convergence between a whole \\nrange of thinkers — in business, in Government and in the green movement \\n— that has lifted environmental issues and environmental management matters to the forefront of business thinking and business practice ... I predict \\nthat, just as good environmental practice has come to be seen as good \\nbusiness, so ... companies will come to terms with finding ways of working, designing, producing and marketing that are driven off concepts of \\nsustainability.”\\n9 \\n \\nThis process will involve extending conventional ideas of a company’s bottom \\nline into something much closer to the triple bottom line. Indeed, there is already \\nearly evidence that this challenge is being recognized and accepted by some business leaders. “As we pursue our strategies worldwide,” said GM CEO and president John \\nF. Smith, Jr.: \\n \\n“we accept a social and environmental res ponsibility as well. These \\nresponsibilities include the promotion of a sustainable economy and \\nrecognition of the accountability we have to the economies, environments, and communities where we do business around the world.”\\n10 \\n \\nOne interesting concept adopted by some Japanese companies is kyosei , literally \\n“living together and working together for the common good.” This phrase, used by \\nCanon chairman Ryuzaburo Kaku, has helped drive the company’s dogged \\npersistence with solar technology, in which it has invested around £100 million.

It will no longer be \\nenough to carry out an environmental impact assessment in advance of a major \\nproject like the Bakun Dam in Malaysia: economic, environmental, and social impact studies will need to proceed in parallel. Not surprisingly, this trend has major \\nimplications for the qualities of leadership we will need in the future. As John Baker \\nputs it: \\n \\n“We need to start moving beyond simple environmental literacy towards a \\nmuch more strategic capability for understanding the long-term implications of business processes and practices for the physical and social environment in \\nwhich we operate. This is where the real debate on stakeholders should be, \\nrather than where it currently is, stuck with a sterile argument on the supremacy of shareholder versus other stakeholder interests.” \\n \\nHappily, there is a new focus on the quality of corporate boards. As leading \\ncompanies try to beef up the calibre of their executive and non-executive directors, \\nBusiness Week recently asked: “Is good corporate governance contagious?”12 We \\nmust hope so, although to date the focus has been on fairly narrow definitions of enhanced shareholder value. To lead business towards the distant goals of \\nsustainability, the new generation of leaders and strategists will need to move well \\nbeyond current definitions and abandon many of the latest management fads and fashions. \\nIn pursuing the triple bottom line, however, they will find much of value in the \\nwork of the management gurus whose work we have briefly reviewed. They would also be well advised to heed Rosabeth Moss Kanter, author of books like World \\nClass.\\n13 Her “3Cs” are as relevant to the sustainability transition as to any other \\nbusiness challenge we face. They are: concepts (knowledge and ideas), competence \\n(the ability to operate at the highest standards), and connections (the capacity to \\nbuild the best relationships, affording access to the necessary global resources). As \\nKanter puts it: “managing means managing an entire context. If you strip out one element and apply one methodology, it won’t work.”\\n14 \\nThe challenge is not to strip eco-efficiency, sustainability or anything else out of \\nits broader context, but instead to integrate these concepts into the very mainstream of management. This is why business leaders need to shift to the broader 7-D vision \\nrequired to build the sustainable corporation.

A key talent will be the ability to encourage people to embrace and \\nachieve demanding “stretch” goals. \\nAt Xerox, for example, the goal of waste-free factories and waste-free products \\nhas led the company into such areas as “remanufacturing.” This involves taking back \\nolder photocopiers and refurbishing them to the point where they can be resold or \\nleased again. These machines are designed to be “as-good-as-new,” and are covered by the company’s standard three-year guarantee. In 1995, the company’s worldwide \\nrecycling programs saved Xerox over $12 million. That same year, the company’s \\nRank Xerox joint venture was recovering some 80,000 of the 120,000 photocopiers discarded each year in western Europe. Again, the benefits were remarkable: in 1995 \\nalone, Rank Xerox saved about £50 million on purchases of virgin raw materials by \\nreusing recovered equipment. And further costs were avoided by diverting over 7,000 tonnes of material which would otherwise have been landfilled.\\n15 \\nOr take DuPont, where the potential of the “Spirit of Zero” now pursued by the \\ngiant chemical company is illustrated by the achievement of an agricultural products team from LaPorte, Texas.

And who \\nnow expects it to stop any time soon? \\nIn the process, however, we are practising a form of “time banditry.” When we \\nuse up non-renewable resources, or compromise renewable resources, we are stealing wealth from the future. In this sense, we are time bandits, raiding the wealth \\nof victims who are often as yet unborn. To restore the balance, we need to build a \\nbetter understanding of “long time” — and to switch from extractive modes of business to modes which, over time, actively rebuild economic, environmental, \\nhuman and social capital. \\nThe problem is that commercial pressures, and most particularly the demands of \\nfinancial markets, will not yet allow most business leaders to move, strongly down \\nthe sustainability path. Any company announcing that it wanted to abandon time \\nbanditry and to appoint “time guardians” to its board runs the risk of seeing its stock marked down sharply. But change will come. \\nSome of the inherent dangers in the ever accelerating shrinkage of commercial \\ntime were underscored while I was writing this chapter. Toyota, a pioneer of just-in-time manufacturing, found that its over-dependence on its keiretsu, or extended \\ngroup, of suppliers could bite back. A fire at Aisin Seiki, in which Toyota had a \\n25%-plus stake, left the giant car company without, sufficient stocks of vital brake parts.\\n17 It was forced to halt all its manufacturing lines in Japan, and the disaster also \\nhit production at hundreds of other companies supplying Toyota, which had no \\noption but to stop their production of Toyota parts. \\nDespite such shocks to the system, however, Toyota is unlikely to abandon its \\nkanban, or just-in-time, approach. In the same way, of course, the pressure on \\nfinancial markets to progressively shorten their time-scales is unlikely to reverse any time soon, despite evidence that short-term thinking can damage our wealth. But, as \\nexplained in Chapter 13, some parts of the financial world are beginning to respond \\nto the ongoing paradigm shift. In response, they are experimenting with new ways of measuring the value that successful environmental and broader triple bottom line \\nstrategies can add over time. Indeed, new research suggests that such strategies can \\nsignificantly boost profitability and help to attract investment. \\nWhen ICF Kaiser, one of the largest US engineering consulting groups, studied \\nthe financial data on over 300 of the largest US public companies over a long period, \\nthe conclusion was inescapable: the volatility of the stock reduced after the introduction of environmental programmes.\\n18 Among the companies which scored \\nhighly were DuPont, IBM and Polaroid.

And, in a complex \\nand fast-paced world, they also need to test their plans against a range of scenarios. But, in the middle of all of this, we should beware of switching people off by \\noverstressing the message that “time is running out.” Too much gloom can be \\ncounter-productive.

These people were \\ndeadly serious about their need to protect their respective interests. These days, \\nhowever, there is often laughter; indeed participants often describe the meetings as “fun.” That, I suspect, is one of the most powerful indicators that partnership \\napproaches are beginning to engage. Some business people may still try to \\nundermine the environmental movement, a process sometimes described as “brownlash,” but many understand, as one executive once said to me, that trying to \\nnail the likes of Greenpeace is tough. “How do you kill Santa Claus?,” he asked. \\nWe are learning to see each other not as enemies, but as potential partners and \\ncomplementors. In the process, the focus is switching from mutual subversion to the \\nevolution of new forms of symbiosis. When Royal Dutch/Shell announced that it \\nwould in future invite environmental and human rights groups to participate in some of its more sensitive projects in the developing world, it sent a powerful message to \\nother companies worldwide. “We should use the increased scrutiny of NGOs as a \\ntool to strengthen our performance,” argued John Jennings, as chairman of Shell Transport and Trading. And he noted that the challenge would be to extend the net \\nsufficiently widely, “including those who wish you were not there.”\\n20 \\nA sense of fun should not imply that there is complacency. Indeed, as Fortune \\nrecently put it, the challenge for all companies is to “Kill complacency before it kills \\nyou.”21 One reason why growing numbers of companies are bringing in triple \\nbottom line partners is to help challenge their thinking and to smash complacency. John Kotter, the Konosuke Matsushita professor of leadership at Harvard business \\nschool, notes that the best way to remove complacency is to turn up the heat in your \\norganization. He advises companies to: \\n \\n“set higher standards both formally in the planning process and informally in \\nday-to-day interaction; change internal measurement systems that focus on the wrong indexes; vastly increase the amount of external feedback everyone gets; \\nreward both honest talk in meetings and people who are willing to confront \\nproblems; and stop baseless happy talk from the top,” \\n \\nIn short, disrupt the (unsustainable) status quo.

If those participating rise to the challenge, all sides \\nemerge from the sessions energized, and the company people say they have a much \\nsharper view of what the outside world wants in the way of improved triple bottom line performance. \\nThe sustainability challenge requires much more than public statements of \\nsupport by CEOs. The real focus of attention should be on the corporate culture. Listen to Dr Vicki Lafare, an American specialist in unravelling corporate cultures \\nand reshaping them to deal with rapid change: \\n \\n“I think the key issue for corporations that hope to become sustainable — and \\nare committed to sustainable development — is one of alignment, starting at \\nthe top and going all the way to the bottom Corporate policies, procedures, practices, real systems — everything must be in line to support their goals.”\\n22 \\n \\nAgreed, but in some companies we have found that you have to work with the grass roots to get the transition started, because the senior management are either \\ndistracted or asleep. \\nThere are many ways in which companies can mobilize their human resources. \\nThey can follow Skandia’s example, mapping and measuring their internal \\nintellectual capital. They can develop processes for building and conserving that \\ncapital. They can use new technologies, such as “groupware,” to enable employees to access shared knowledge resources via Intranets. And they can adopt new, softer \\nmanagement approaches, which encourage managers and other employees to \\ndevelop their capacity for sustained creativity-on-demand, with books like John Kao’s Jamming\\n23 suggesting that the improvisational styles of jazz can help manage \\ntoday’s increasingly virtual organizations. \\nOutside partners can also help enormously in this process, bringing different \\nperspectives and experience to bear, providing new tools and benchmarks, and \\nhelping to hold management and others to account for progress. Growing numbers \\nof companies worldwide are developing “strange alliances” with triple bottom line campaigning organizations, among them BP,  S.C. Johnson, McDonald’s, Monsanto, \\nNovo Nordisk and Unilever. In doing so, such companies are having to recognize \\nthat stakeholder dialogue is not simply a way of getting your opponents close enough in to ensure they really hear what you are trying to say.

If they are to sustain critical triple bottom line partnerships, \\nthey must learn to understand their partner’s real needs and achieve consistency over time. It makes no sense, for example, to profess support for a social agenda, and then \\nhave one’s own industry — or, worse, one’s own company — fight to remove \\nregulations or standards designed to promote that agenda. On the other hand, we all know that regulations and standards can be made more efficient and effective. So if \\nchange is needed, fight for  reregulation,  not deregulation. \\nCompanies should not expect unconditional loyalty from their triple bottom line \\npartners, any more than they would in other areas of their business.

In the wake of the first environmental wave, \\npesticide manufacturers were among the first to recognize the need for “product \\nstewardship.” Instead of simply handing over highly toxic substances to customers \\nregardless of their ability to use them safely, far-sighted chemical companies woke up to the fact that this was a form of commercial suicide. To protect their own \\nfutures, they would have to take at least some responsibility for the handling of their \\nproducts from “cradle to grave.” In effect, they were bundling environmental services with their products. The cost of doing so may be one of the factors driving \\nthe evolution of much safer alternatives. \\nPractice remains imperfect even in the world of pesticides, but the product \\nstewardship concept is also taking root in other markets. So, for example, packaging \\nmanufacturers are increasingly subject to “take back” requirements, an approach \\ndesigned to encourage much higher levels of recycling. This, in turn, is reinforcing the trend for companies to shift the focus of their attention from raw sales to lifetime \\ncustomer value. Clearly, if this approach is to pay off, there is a real benefit in \\ncompanies being around for the long haul. Competitors that are in and out of the business will simply be unable to afford the investment in the environmental \\nservices and infrastructures needed to sustain a market presence long-term. \\nNot surprisingly, we are seeing the twin areas of life-cycle assessment and life-\\ncycle design evolving in response. The pace of development may at times seem \\nfrustratingly slow for practitioners, but viewed from the perspective of “long” time \\nwe have made dramatic progress during the post 1945 period. SoLCA can focus on boosting the net contributions of a material, process, product, or development in \\nterms of financial capital (e.g. life-cycle costing), natural capital (e.g. life-cycle \\nenvironmental accounting) or social capital (e.g. life-cycle social accounting). And we are also seeing life-cycle assessment and design professionals beginning to toy \\nwith the problem of integrating the economic, environmental, and social dimensions \\nof emerging market requirements. \\nThese new perspectives will drive companies in a number of directions. It is \\ninevitable, for example, that successful companies will increasingly take \\nresponsibility for the triple bottom line performance of suppliers. Simultaneously, companies producing high levels of waste will either be forced to drop these \\ninefficient technologies or, in a subtle twist, to evolve sophisticated co-product \\nstrategies. Tioxide is one company which has invested a great deal of effort in turning materials which once went to waste into a range of products, from insulating \\nwall-board through to magnetic tape.

Recall the Belgian government issuing an angry protest to \\nFrance over what it called the “brutal and unacceptable” decision by the French carmaker Renault to close its Belgian factory, with the loss of 3,100 jobs.\\n37 The \\nBelgian prime minister expressed “indignation and stupefaction,” but investors in \\nRenault applauded the decision: the company’s shares promptly jumped 13%. \\nRenault defended its decision by saying that it planned to transfer production to \\nexisting plants in France and Spain, where the same number of cars could be made \\nwith just 1,900 staff. Of course, there were many other factors at work, among them the crippling social contributions faced by employers in Belgium, which have \\nhampered the Belgian government’s efforts to tackle the country’s high \\nunemployment figures. \\nSuch decisions and, probably, the political indignation they trigger, will be an \\ninevitable part of our future, whether or not we shift towards a sustainable economy. \\nGlobalization will drive tremendous transformations and trigger huge dislocations. But, in the midst of all this, cultural changes around the world are making it harder \\nfor business leaders to simply project an image of ruthlessness. While financial \\nanalysts may mark up a company’s stock when it moves to slash costs, social analysts are likely to raise real questions about the implications for local \\ncommunities and society. As a result, a growing political, if not always yet financial, \\npremium is likely to be attached to corporate boards which can demonstrate that they are fully aware of (and selectively responsive to) triple bottom line issues. \\n“When we talk of changing values,” said Jehangir Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata, for \\ndecades chairman of India’s Tata Iron and Steel Company, “we are sometimes inclined to think only of changes for the worse.”\\n38 This, he noted, was wrong-\\nheaded, since there have been many changes for the better. He pointed to “the \\ngrowing acceptance by industry and business of their social responsibilities to the underprivileged sections of society and to the environment.” He was speaking in \\n1983, ironically the year before the horrendous Bhopal disaster. Does that mean he \\nwas wrong’? Not at all. Indeed Tata has continuously provided a model of excellence for other Indian companies. But the message is that the necessary values \\ntransition is still in its embryonic phase. \\nSome companies will choose to tackle these issues separately from their core \\nbusinesses. Whirlpool, for example, has the Whirlpool Foundation, which has a clear \\nfocus on such social issues as lifelong learning, cultural diversity, and contemporary \\nfamily life. The company also funds research on the attitudes of women to work,', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 342}),\n",

No doubt, some of the relevant insights feed back directly \\ninto the company’s core business strategies, but this is a less direct mechanism than \\ncompanies which decide to integrate triple bottom line thinking into every relevant \\naspect of their core businesses. \\nWherever it operates, a company is likely to find that any major business action \\ninevitably triggers a proportionate and opposite political reaction among \\nstakeholders. As a result, whether the focus is on financial, natural, human, or social capital, the emphasis will shift from simple control to active stewardship. In some \\ncases, we may well see a growing focus on how we can deliver “enough” rather than \\n“more.” The claim that we are moving from a “me” society to a “we” society may seem exaggerated, but after years of market-driven change we should expect to see \\nsome profound transformations driven by emerging (or resurfacing) values in this \\narea. \\nIn parallel, the sustainability transition will require that we shift the emphasis \\nfrom economic growth (with its focus on quantity) to sustainable development (with \\nits focus on economic, environmental, and social qualities). This, in turn, will utterly depend on our capacity to think in longer time and to recognize that quality depends \\non our ability to recognize, respect, manage, and sustain diversity. \\nExpect a backlash against agricultural, economic, socio-cultural, and even \\npolitical monocultures. Genetic, ecological, and cultural diversity will often be \\nhighly prized, as — too often — the supply shrinks. A key area in which the value of \\ndiversity is increasingly appreciated is ecology. Recent research shows that the more diverse an ecosystem, for example, the better it is in absorbing carbon dioxide, and \\nmoderating global warming. As a result, a waste management company like WMX \\nnow finds it essential to set itself the goal of ensuring that its operations result in no net loss of biodiversity. \\nAs far as social diversity is concerned, most of us who think of a sustainable \\nfuture tend to think in terms of a global future which would suit our own individual, corporate, or national interests. This seems unlikely. A sustainable world is very \\nunlikely to be homogenous. Sustainable lifestyles won’t come off production lines \\nlike early Fords. Instead, like plants evolving a variety of shapes, colours, and reproductive strategies around their common core of chlorophyll-based \\nphotosynthesis, so future lifestyles are likely to be spectacularly diverse, even \\nthough they must increasingly converge around overall resource efficiency. \\nIndeed, one model of 21st century business could be the famed, Montreal-based \\nCirque du Soleil, which I had the pleasure of seeing while writing Cannibals With \\nForks.

Now, by contrast, some companies are recognizing that diverse companies do better in \\ndiverse markets. Ernst H.

While writing \\nCannibals, for example, I was asked to visit a small company, Tropical Marine \\nCentre (TMC), alongside one of the investment team from the National \\nProvident Institution (NPI), which runs a series of “global care” investment funds. As a member of NPI’s environmental advisory committee, I ha\\nd \\nexpressed concern about the tropical fish business of Cranswick plc, one of the \\ncompanies in which NPI had invested. NPI had originally invested on the strength of Cranswick’s “high welfare” pig forming operation, but we were \\nconcerned that the company’s TMC subsidiary might be less appetizing for \\nethical investors. \\nI confess my mind was already pretty much made up when I set off with NPI \\nanalyst Alex Gozzi to meet TMC’s top management. “Ornamental’ tropical fish \\nare wonderful to watch, clearly, but most are still caught in the wild. Yet what we saw confounded many of our expectations. Yes, TMC, which employs some \\n50 people, is now Europe’s largest supplier of marine livestock, marine fish feed, \\nand associated aquaria products. Yes, most of the fish are still collected in the wild. And, yes, the tanks in meticulously clean holding areas contain live corals \\ntaker from reefs which are now among the world’s endangered ecosystems. \\nYes, but managing director Richard Sankey turned out to be every bit as \\nmuch an environmentalist as most of the campaigners we work with. Having set \\nup TMC in 1970, he has used the business to campaign for higher standards \\nthroughout the value chain. Whereas many of his competitors have accepte\\nd \\nhigh mortality rates among the fish they catch, ship, and sell, Sankey decided to \\naim for “zero loss.” Today, thanks to efforts right back down to the point o f \\ncapture, TMC is tantalizingly close to zero loss across the board, and has achieved the target with some species. \\nThose who do the catching are trained in the dangers of overfishing and in \\nthe principles of sustainable fisheries. Shipping is handled in a way which means a minimum of stress to the fish in transit — and there is a carefully programmed \\nacclimatization process once they arrive in the UK. Antibiotics are not used at \\nany point in the operation, on the basis that they are generally a desperate remedy for poor fish husbandry, And the company is also captive breeding \\na \\nnumber of species, with tank-bred clownfish the main success to date.

The competitive challenge posed by the triple bottom line is illustrated \\nby the experience of the Body Shop International. \\n“How can you ennoble the spirit,” founder Anita Roddick once remarked self-\\ndeprecatingly, “when you are selling something as inconsequential as a face \\ncream?”\\n40 Part of the answer, the Body Shop concluded, was to link the company’s \\nmarketing strategy with the campaigns of groups such as Amnesty International and \\nGreenpeace. Unfortunately, as Fortune put it, although the strategy paid off in \\nspades, the company’s top executives “began spending an increasing amount of time launching environmental projects rather than revamping the company’s ageing \\nproduct line. The head of finance was detailed to help set up a windmill farm in \\nWales,” designed to ecologically replace the electricity used at the company’s UK headquarters offices. Meanwhile, the market for the company’s core products was \\nnot standing still. The Body Shop lost ground to competitors, among them Bath & \\nBody Works, particularly in the US market. None of this is an argumentBut the real clincher, as for as I was concerned, was the lobbying TMC has \\nbeen carrying out in an attempt to stop one of the most destructive activities as \\nfar the reefs of the Philippines are concerned: cyanide fishing. Late in the \\nSecond World War, when the occupying Japanese had withdrawn and Filipinos \\nwere starving in their hundreds of thousands, some bright spark discovered tha t \\nif you took the cyanide which was used to protect copra plantations against pests \\nand dumped it in the sea, the result was that multitudes of stunned fish floated to \\nthe surface. Fine, perhaps, in the midst of a famine, but the cyanide fishing continues to this day, and the impact on reef and sea-floor habitats is staggering. \\nSankey and his colleagues have helped to permanently change standards i\\nn \\nthe marine fishkeeping industry. If we tried to ban the trade, it would go underground and standards would inevitably deteriorate. So, to my surprise, I \\ncaught the London train believing that if TMC can radically boost the number o\\nf \\nspecies it breeds and keep the pressure up on the cyanide front, then this small company has probably earned its place in the sustainable investment portfolio.

As they do, new financial funds will emerge dedicated to tracking and investing in companies committed to best practice.

Each of the revolutions will itself need to be guided, \\nnurtured, resourced, and explained.

Anyone who thinks \\notherwise might usefully read Bernice Cohen’s The Edge of Chaos, which explores \\nthe underlying structure in the world’s recurrent financial booms, bubbles, and \\ncrashes.3 Crashes and bubbles, she demonstrates, “seem to be an inherent part of \\nindustrial capitalism.” The legendary US investor, Benjamin Graham, compared the behavior of the stock market to that of a manic depressive. At times, the views of \\ninvestors veer from “the ridiculously high to the absurdly low” as excessive \\noptimism gives way to equally extreme gloom. \\nAre bubbles and crashes a thing of the past? Hardly. They appear to be closely \\nlinked to human psychology, most particularly to social psychology. While we can \\ncertainly understand them better by applying chaos and complexity theory, they seem to be as inevitable as the weather. As a result, those responsible for guiding \\nand driving the sustainability transition must learn to minimize the risk of their \\noccurrence, predict their arrival when conditions are heading in the wrong direction, cut the damage caused when they arrive, and manage sustainable recoveries where \\nbubbles or crashes have happened. \\nNot that stability is particularly desirable in a world which we know to be \\nunsustainable.

For much of the time, as \\nTom Peters has put it, business is immersed in a “sea of similarities.” Jean \\nBaudrillard called it a “Xeroxed world.” \\nBut, as JeanMarie Dru put it in his book Disruption , “faced with this situation, \\ncompanies understand that they cannot go on doing things as they’ve always done \\nthem. Too often, without realizing it, they fall into another kind of conformity.

Creativity as a tool for change.” \\n \\nAnd it is the creativity of business and markets that must now drive the disruptions \\nthat sustainability demands. \\nBeing customer-driven, as Dru points out, is no guarantee of coming up with the \\nright answers. There are real limits to being consumer-led. “After all,” he argues, \\n“the consumer can’t imagine the future any better than anyone else.” And that is one \\nof the reasons why companies are beginning to form strategic alliances with triple bottom line partners, to enhance the flow of new thinking and business concepts.  \\nIn the past, campaigners, the media, policy-makers, and regulators were the main \\nsources of the triple bottom line discontinuities which so disrupted business.

It applied for 127 blocks on the continental shift, announcing that if successful in its bid (a wildly \\nunlikely outcome), it would not undertake any oil and gas exploration, but would \\ncarry out extensive wildlife surveys. Increasingly, however, companies themselves will begin to adopt disruptive strategies designed to radically improve their financial \\nperformance by meeting emerging triple bottom line needs and expectations.

The problem, though, is that short electoral time-scales mean that \\nthey are often extremely short-sighted. But, in the end, many sustainability issues \\nwill resolve into questions of power: who controls, who decides. This area will be full of trade-offs. If, for example, a company improves its environmental \\nperformance, yet slashes its workforce, can we say it is sustainable in the full sense \\nof the word? These questions go to the heart of the sustainability debate, which is about combining environmental and development considerations in ways that are not \\n“either/or,” but “both/and” — the “win—win—win” balance required by the triple \\nbottom line. \\nClearly, the political dimensions of the sustainability transition will be central, \\nyet it remains a sad fact that genuine 7-D vision remains beyond the reach of most of \\ntoday’s political class. Margaret Thatcher, Mikhail Gorbachev, and George Bush switched on in the late 1980s, but only Gorbachev showed any signs of staying the \\nenvironmental course.

So if we are \\nright about the nature and scale of the sustainability challenge, we are very likely to \\nsee a new generation of leaders emerging. Part of the challenge will be to identify \\nthem early and to nurture and support them as they emerge. \\n \\nA Focus on the Future \\nWhether we do it with a strong political vision (a man on the Moon by 1970, for example, or Singapore as a “wired society”), a Ministry of the Future, the use of scenarios, or the burial of a Millennium Clock, we must work to develop a longer \\ntime-frame for our thinking on such areas as investment, science, and education.

Businessman Masayoshi Son may be able to think 300 years ahead, and science-fiction author Arthur C.

Increasingly, critics of free market capitalism argue that the invisible hand cannot do it all, and that many people need a \\nhelping hand.\\n6 Even George Soros, the staunch anti-communist investor who has \\ngiven millions to support democracy in Eastern Europe, argues that unbridled self-interest and laissez-faire policies could destroy capitalism from within. \\nInevitably, his arguments attracted a storm of criticism, yet there is truth on both \\nsides. “Perhaps we should be saying: ‘Free is good — but read the fine print,” ‘ said Claudia D. Goldin, an economic historian with Harvard University.

In its absence, you risk rapid \\ndegeneration into the sort of lawless anarchy we have seen in countries like Albania \\nand parts of the old Soviet Union. Even in the developed world, there are many areas where the laws still need tightening and enforcing more effectively, but many \\npolitical leaders tend to duck calls for tighter controls, or even regulation, preferring \\nto leave the problems to later administrations. \\nIn part, this flows from a fear of failure. Yet the evidence shows that even \\napparently drastic changes can be achieved as long as there is sufficient political \\ncommitment. The most spectacular example of industrial change in recent years has probably been the shift out of ozone-depleting substances like CFCs. The best study \\nto date focused on the Us economy’s experience and was produced by the World \\nResources Institute (WRI).\\n8 As WRI president Jonathan Lash put it, “Less than a \\ndecade ago, (CFCs) were entrenched in the US economy. More than a 100 billion \\ndollars’ worth of equipment relied on CFCs.” At the time, US industries used a third \\nof all CFCs produced worldwide.

In case after case, the WRI report notes, \\n“firms have eliminated CFCs faster, at lower cost, or with greater technological \\nimprovements than ever imagined.” \\nAmong the critical factors in achieving this success were: environmental goals \\nthat were sufficiently flexible to be easily adapted to Dew scientific evidence; the \\nuse of economic instruments (including tradable consumption permits and a tax on \\nozone-depleting chemicals); and entrepreneurial government programs designed to help spread best practice, together with the necessary skills and funding. \\nThere have been arguments that we can do without regulations, yet nothing could \\nbe further from the truth. New laws may not always be the most efficient way of reshaping markets, but experience shows that they can be effective if well designed. \\nAgain, German industry protested mightily about the proposed takeback law, which \\nassigns extended producer responsibility to all companies that develop, manufacture, process, or market products in the country. But once the law came into force late in \\n1996 they set to work trying to understand how the new “circular economy” and \\nclosed-loop value chains might be created and operated. \\nClearly, the early costs will be high, as companies struggle to take back and \\nreprocess products and materials which were never designed to be recovered, \\nremanufactured, or recycled. But longer term the closed loop logic should become second nature. As for the corporate casualties, German research suggests that small \\nand medium-sized companies will be most vulnerable.\\n9 Among the problems they \\nface are lack of time, lack of information, and unfocused apprehension about the likely costs and competitive impacts. Among the possible remedies are government \\nsupport programs, green business networks, and the provision of free or cheap \\nadvice and information over the Internet. \\nOne key is to believe that change for the better is possible. Indeed, there are a \\ngrowing number of success stories to demonstrate that the reshaping of markets with \\ntriple bottom line objectives in mind can work. Consider California’s recent experiments with reformulated (or oxygenated) gasoline The Dew fuel may cost 10 \\ncents a gallon extra, but most motorists accept that the benefits have been worth it: \\nthere has been a 50% cut in concentrations of airborne benzene, a known human carcinogen.\\n10 The beneficial impact of the new fuel has been equivalent to taking \\n3,500,000 cars off California’s roads.

According to the \\nOECD, the number of market-based instruments in industrial countries increased by 50% between 1989 and 1994.\\n11 Such instruments use market forces to encourage \\nproducers and consumers to cut their triple bottom line impacts. A typical approach \\nmight be to put a price tag on emissions, so as to discourage air or water pollution, or to charge for access to national parks, so that peaks in visitor numbers are \\nsmoothed and revenues boosted. \\nA key part of the problem is that today’s prices often mislead us. As Ernst Ulrich \\nvon Weizsacker of Germany’s Wuppertal Institute has forcefully argued over many \\nyears, we need to ensure that prices increasingly tell the truth; the economic truth, \\nthe social truth, and the ecological truth. As he puts it in Factor Four,  written with \\nAmory and Hunter Lovins of the Rocky Mountain Institute, “We need economic \\nperestroika built on economic glasnost , for if our prices tell lies, they cannot guide \\ntrue choices.”\\n12 \\nIn America, for example: \\n \\n“the social costs of driving — related both to the conversion of fuel into smog \\nand to congestion, lost time, accidents, roadway damage, land use and other \\nside-effects of driving itself — are largely socialized. ‘External’ costs \\napproaching 1 trillion dollars a year, perhaps a seventh of the American GDP, are borne by everyone, but not reflected in drivers’ direct costs.” \\n \\nYet there is clear evidence that proper pricing can work.

This level playing field, \\nwhere cars and (public mass) transit both pay their way, yields a liveable city.” \\n \\nIncreasingly, too, new electronic gadgetry will enable governments or operators to levy such charges automatically, without the need for toll-booths. \\nFactor Four should be required reading for politicians and policymakers around \\nthe world. One area where they will increasingly take action is in relation to the extraordinary range of subsidies which currently distort markets. “Governments \\ndon’t intend to waste money or destroy the environment,” as David Malin Roodman \\nputs it, “but the fact is, most are obsolete or ineffective, and are hard to defend even before the taxpayer, consumer and environmental costs are added in.”\\n13 \\nThere are many examples of the triple bottom line impacts of misconceived \\nsubsidies. Let’s take just three of those quoted. First, government subsidies for the global fishing fleet have helped produce enough boats, nets, and other equipment to \\ncatch twice the available fish. Second, in addition to what drivers pay in gas, car, \\nand road taxes, US taxpayers directly subsidize drivers to the tune of 70 cents for every gallon of gas or diesel fuel sold. And, third, the cost of protecting a hard coal \\njob in Germany through subsidies had reached $72,800 a year by the late 1990s. It \\nwould be cheaper to shut down the mines and pay the miners not to work. \\nMore positively, it is clear that there is now a growing range of market-based \\ninstruments, including deposit-refund systems used in the packaging sector, \\nsubsidies (such as grants, soft loans, or accelerated depreciation for desirable activities), arid tradable permits. The purpose of the last of these is to allow \\npolluting industries more flexibility in deciding how they spend limited financial \\nresources across various pollution sources, while permitting governments to maintain a firm limit on the total volume of polluting emissions.\\n14 \\nProbably the most controversial economic instruments are taxes. Tax reform is \\nrarely easy, but it is increasingly clear that a range of environmental taxes (or eco-taxes) have a central role to play in the sustainability transition. Among the benefits \\nwhich they are expected to bring are greater flexibility than legislation, clear signals \\nthrough markets to producers and consumers, and the prospect of revenues which can, if allowed to, be used to fund specific environmental tasks or to reduce labor \\ncosts and thereby boost employment.

Although early enthusiasm for energy taxes has often been blunted by fears about the impact on \\ncompetitiveness, the beginnings of a significant shift of taxation from labor to \\nresources and pollution cannot be long delayed. The challenge for political leaders is not now to debate whether we need such a shift, but to work out how, when, and \\nwhere it should be implemented — and how to maximize the “soft effects” (i.e. \\nchanges in attitudes) of such measures. \\nIn Sweden, the evidence suggests that tax reform can deliver the “g oods.” In one \\nof the world’s largest exercises in using taxes to protect the environment, beginning \\nin 1984, there was a 30% reduction in acid rain between 1989 and 1995.\\n16 The taxes \\nhave encouraged power generation companies to invest in desulphurization \\nequipment and buy low-sulphur fuels.

They influence our thinking and priorities far more profoundly than most \\nof us are prepared to accept.

These emerging needs represent major commercial opportunities for those who spot them in time, just as Ted Turner spotted the need \\nfor a global news service and hung in there with his embryonic CNN. \\nToo often, however, as during the CFC transition, the choices we are presented \\nwith are artificially stark. We are offered a choice between environment and jobs, \\nbetween cold homes and global warming, between order and chaos. Yet these are \\nnot real choices: they are political levers, designed to force us to moderate our demands. Such false choices need to be exposed for what they are. The public needs \\nto be shown what is possible, if the will, the money, and, most importantly, the \\nquantum leap creativity can be found. \\nBusiness Leaders \\nMany of today’s business leaders come from a generation which was acutely aware \\nof markets and, to a degree, of corporate governance issues.

Nor are these issues particularly high on the agenda for many of the business schools training up their successors. But things are beginning the change. \\nNot that you would guess it by looking at the business news. And there are good \\nreasons. Too many of today’s business leaders continue to lay off thousands of people while, at the same time, taking massive pay-rises.

Too often, it \\nseems, they also have little understanding of the social consequences of their actions.

Among other recent \\ninitiatives, Business in the Environment (BiE), a consortium of major companies, \\nrecently published its first benchmark survey assessing the environmental \\ncommitment of the FT-SE 100 companies (see Case Study, p. 358).

Let’s take, as a topical example, the world’s fisheries; a real \\ntest-case of sustainability. The world’s media regularly run stories on how over-fishing is emptying the seas and oceans of their most important commercial fish \\nstocks.\\n25 Commercial fishing is an example of a massive industry with often \\nconflicting economic, social, and ecological objectives. \\nToday’s methods of controlling vessel numbers, mesh sizes, quotas for catches \\nand by-catches, and so on are hugely complex, but you don’t need to be a brain \\nsurgeon to know that many of our great fisheries, and the industries and communities that depend upon them, are unsustainable. It’s an extraordinary fact, \\ntoo, that the world’s governments currently spend over $50 billion a year to \\nsubsidize a fishing industry worth $70 billion. No doubt there are concealed triple bottom line objectives here, including the sustenance of local communities and \\nemployment, but something is clearly going wrong. \\nNo-one disputes that universal solutions to such problems are unlikely. The most \\neffective remedies will vary from country to country. But those fisheries that have \\nintroduced market mechanisms have generally done well. These typically work in \\nthe following way. Fishermen acquire a share (quota) of the resource and harvest it in the most desirable manner, generally trying to maximize returns on their \\ninvestment, subject to whatever legal constraints the government has implemented. \\nSince the fishermen own or lease the quota, each share owner has an incentive to ensure that the stocks are harvested in such a way as to ensure future sustainability. \\nMoreover, in cases where these stocks are transferable (i.e. they can be sold on), the \\nsystem can also favor the most efficient fishermen. \\nSo far, of course, such market approaches cannot be used on the high seas, where \\nno individual country has exclusive jurisdiction — so access to the resource cannot \\nbe limited. But this is another challenge for the future. How do we put in place (and then effectively police) regimes which help conserve and rebuild our natural \\nresources?

Three areas on which SEI is focusing are: design for the environment; profit and loss management; and performance indicators and measurement. \\nSince engineers estimate that 80–90% of the cost of a typical product, and some \\n80% of its environmental impact, is determined at the design stage, this is the logical place to start. Key focus areas will include designing for optimum material, energy, \\nand water efficiency, and designing for disassembly, remanufacturing and recycling. \\nThe profit and loss (P&L) statement is a basic management tool used by general managers to guide operations, investments, and sale projections.

Once the carpet reaches the end of its useful life, a new floor covering is supplied to replace the old and the “spent” \\nproduct is remanufactured and reintroduced into the market after refurbishing, \\nremanufacturing, or a fashion facelift.\\n27 \\nValue chains can also be used as powerful levers for change in industries which \\nhave not yet decided to make the necessary changes.

CFCs are only part of the transition. What happens when we \\nstart to squeeze out carbon-based fuels, or road transport, or chlorine compounds? In the process, we will see extraordinary shifts in the centre of gravity of our \\neconomies. Read Adrian Slywotzky’s Value Migration.\\n32 His basic premise is \\nsimple. As industries or companies develop, they go through a period of value inflow (where they begin to absorb value from others whose business designs are \\noutmoded), then through a period of stability (where they are well matched to \\ncustomer priorities and overall competitive equilibrium), followed by a period of value outflow (as better business designs emerge). \\nBetween 1983 and 1992, for example, IBM is estimated to have lost; $70 billion \\nof market value as competitors, particularly Microsoft, scooped up new markets and customers. Environmental and other triple bottom line factors can have precisely the \\nsame effect, be it on products, companies, industries, or even entire economies. For \\nexample. when the US Vinyl Institute commissioned a study of the market prospects for vinyl, or PVC, through to the year 2020, the conclusion was that potential growth \\ncould take the industry to as much as $61 billion in value by 2020.\\n33 On the other \\nhand, environmental pressures could limit the industry to less than $23 billion over the same period. The $38 billion difference between the two scenarios indicates the \\neconomic value of the “triple win” game that the vinyl industry must now learn how \\nto play. \\nFinancial institutions and analysts that get ahead of this curve and ride it through \\nwill likely benefit hugely. So it should come as no surprise to find some major \\nfinancial organizations beginning to align themselves with the emerging reality. This is why Norway’s largest insurer, Storebrand, has joined forces with US money \\nmanager Scudder, Stevens & Clark to launch the Environmental Value Fund.

Indeed, one of the key reasons \\nthat the triple bottom line is now becoming a board-level agenda item is that success \\ndepends on careful prioritization and integrated strategies. \\nSustainability audit frameworks are still evolving. But it is essential that any \\nsuch audit covers all three dimensions of sustainable development, and, most \\nimportantly, the interfaces between them. Any company organization wanting to assess the sustainability of its management systems, operations, value chains, and \\nmarkets also needs to consider the likely impacts of the seven sustainability \\nrevolutions. \\nSo, to briefly recap, here are some of the key conclusions that we have reached \\nto date: \\n ♦ Chapter 2 We asked whether capitalism is sustainable. The conclusion was \\nthat it all depends on what it is that you are trying to sustain. But there are \\nnow good reasons to believe that we can evolve sustainable forms of capitalism if business and, equally importantly, the world’s financial \\nmarkets can get to grips with the seven sustainability revolutions. \\n♦ Chapter 3 We looked at the two great waves, and ensuing downwaves, of \\nenvironmentalism, and reviewed some of the likely characteristics of the \\nnext wave. One key characteristic, alongside the increasing complexity and \\npace of development, will be a new focus on the triple bottom line. \\n♦ Chapter 4 The triple bottom line, in turn, will require new forms of \\naccounting, auditing, reporting, and benchmarking. At the same time, \\ntroubling new issues are already surfacing in the “shear zones” between the bottom line agendas. \\n♦ Chapter 5 The sustainability community must now recognize that \\nSustainability Revolution 1 will mean that triple bottom line goals and targets will increasingly need to be met by working with business and \\nthrough markets. \\n♦ Chapter 6 Revolution 2 will mean that diverse human and societal values \\nwill be on the boardroom agenda as never before. This trend, coupled with \\nthe spread of high-technology communication media and the erosion of \\ntraditional centres of authority, creates the “ghost in the system” with which boards will now need to wrestle. \\n♦ Chapter 7 Revolution 3 will turn the global business environment into the \\nelectronic equivalent of a goldfish bowl. As a result, business thinking, commitments, and actions will be under scrutiny as never before. Some \\ncompanies will try to develop “stealth” maneuvers, in the hope of slipping', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 387}),\n",

As a result, life-cycle thinking will be a key feature of 21st-\\ncentury business. \\n♦ Chapter 9  Revolution 5 will accelerate the process of alliance-building and \\npartnership development between leading companies and a growing range of \\nactual or potential “complementors.” These partnerships will also help to drive Revolutions 1–4, 6 and 7. \\n♦ Chapter 10  Revolution 6 will be based on, and spotlight, new ways of \\nperceiving, valuing, and managing time. None of this will be friction-free, however. The collision of different time-perspectives, whether wide or long, \\nwill be a key feature of the 21st-century business environment. \\n♦ Chapter 11 Because of all the above, Revolution 7 will require that corporate \\ngovernance systems evolve rapidly — and that corporate boards begin to \\nunderstand the full range of changes likely to be required by stakeholder \\ncapitalism. Stakeholder dialog is likely to be among the most important of these new requirements. \\n♦ Chapter 12  Here we ran through “39 steps to sustainability,” which will be \\nessential for any corporation determined to build sustainability thinking and targets into the very core of its policies and practices. In each case, we focused \\nin on a number of old-to-new paradigm shifts needed to drive the sustainability \\ntransition. \\n♦ Chapter 13  Recognizing that all of this represents perhaps the most profound \\nchallenge our species has yet faced, we then focused on necessary changes in \\nsuch areas as governance, regulation, and taxation, together with the implications in terms of such areas as shared responsibility and value migration. \\n \\nThis is a huge agenda, clearly. But it is manageable, so long as a company or \\norganization understands the direction and pace of change — and has ways of \\nmeasuring progress against a range of key triple bottom line performance indicators. \\nBelow, we run through some of the basic questions that will almost certainly need to be asked when designing and conducting a sustainability audit.

In a no-holds-barred AGM or press \\nconference, the chairman or CEO has announced the company’s conversion to the \\ncause. The triple bottom line is now part of the language. Board members and \\nemployees are enjoying the worm glow as they leave the ranks of the public’s \\nenemies and, hopefully by the evening news or next morning’s papers, join the list \\nof white knights. \\nAnd then the chill hits.

I asked Pieter Winsemius, once the Netherlands’ \\nEnvironment Minister and now head of McKinsey’s environment practice. \\nOne of the biggest barriers to change, he notes, is that a company’s internal \\nsystems too often fail to support top management’s message, To prove his point, he \\noffers Figure 1, based on a recent McKinsey survey of companies. On the left, the \\nresponses show 78% of respondents in three major companies strongly agreeing that \\nthe environment should be among the top three priorities of line management.

This is designed to reinforce or shift attitudes and values in the \\nappropriate directions. It involves education, internal, and external communication, \\nand a clear definition of the challenge. Think of Bob Shapiro at Monsanto or Cor \\nHerkströter at Shell. \\nInevitably, however, even the most committed boards often find that their new \\ninitiatives run into a range of internal and external barriers. What to do? Winsemius \\nadvises two linked steps at this point: STEER and REWARD. Targets need to be set, \\nadequate resources allocated, and examples of successful approaches widely \\ncommunicated. High-fliers also need to be steered into the new area, to signal \\nserious intent. At the some time, progress towards the right attitudes, values, and \\nbehaviors needs to be measured and rewarded. Recognition for achievement is \\ncrucial, but as Figure 1 suggests, incentive systems at all levels should also \\nfinancially reward the right actions. For those who find the transition a struggle, \\nthere needs to be counselling and other forms of back-up. \\nAnd then, as appropriate behaviors begin to emerge, they will need support.  \\nThey must be reinforced, spread, and developed by new structures and systems. \\nInitially, these may be solely internal, but life-cycle thinking dictates that eventually \\nthey will need to embrace all key stages in the company’s value chain.

In the same way, the thinking of the \\nsustainability movement will take at least a generation to transform our world and \\nour vision of the future. If we date the process from the publication of the Brundtland Commission’s report, Our Common Future, in 1987, then we still have \\n20–30 years before the process really gets into its stride. But the pace of change is \\naccelerating. In retrospect, it is clear that 1995 marked a critical year in the development of this new, broader-based agenda for business and for society. \\nIn controversies like those triggered by the Brent Spar, the executions of Ken \\nSaro-Wiwa and his colleagues, and the extraordinary political and economic convulsions caused by “mad cow” disease, we saw real evidence of the values shift \\ndiscussed in Chapter 6. The size of the gap between today’s world and anything \\napproaching a sustainable future was increasingly clear, although few business leaders, or politicians for that matter, seemed to have much of a clue on ways of \\nbridging the chasm. \\nBut the string of controversies that erupted through the mid- 1990s helped bring \\nthe agenda into much sharper focus. Indeed, it was as if a number of seed crystals \\nhad been dropped into a series of super-saturated solutions. Anyone who remembers \\ncarrying out this experiment in the school laboratory knows that a solution teetering on the edge of crystallizing into a solid can be provoked into making the “phase \\nchange” by dropping in a surprisingly small object. The same is true of human \\npolitics, where particular events or figures can trigger reactions which were previously almost unimaginable. Interestingly, too, once the political phase change \\nhas happened it can be extremely difficult to reverse the reaction. \\nInevitably, many of the students using the web-site developed by the World \\nBusiness Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) — described in Chapter \\n13— will find themselves wrestling with aspects of the triple bottom line agenda \\nduring their careers. Indeed, few things are as certain since the process of globalization, as described in earlier chapters, now embraces not only economic \\ndimensions but also social and environmental dimensions. We are seeing evidence \\nof financial superconductivity, as described in Chapter 5, but we are also seeing evidence of social and political superconductivity, often catalyzed by unexpected \\nside-effects of economic globalization. So, for example, as western lifestyles invade \\nthe developing world, the World Health Organization (WHO) expects an', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 399}),\n",

According to WHO director Dr Paul Kleihaus: \\n \\n“There is a dramatic trend for globalisation of the Western lifestyle and a \\nparallel globalisation of the associated diseases. We had expected this, but we \\nare nevertheless surprised at the pace at which this is happening. Cancer rates \\nare soaring in countries which hardly knew the disease a few years ago.” \\n \\nChanges in diet and the growth of smoking in Asia and Africa appear to be mostly to \\nblame.2 Ironically, the growth of developing world cigarette markets is enabling the \\ntobacco companies to pay off their liabilities in the West! \\nThe challenge will not only be to spot areas where such effects are about to \\nsurface but also to develop ways of measuring progress against the triple bottom line, which is where “shadow pricing” and similar techniques potentially come in. \\nAs the pace of change accelerates and the world becomes more complex, the risks \\nassociated with blind-spots, highlighted in the Executive Summary, can only grow. Hence the value of close dialog with a range of stakeholders, given that their \\nnetworks and radar-screens are likely to pick up trends and issues which may slip in \\nunder your own organization’s radar. But corporate boards need to recognize that the very fact that we are seeing powerful globalization trends does not mean that we will \\ninevitably see homogenization of the world’s social or environmental agendas, no \\nmore than we will see complete economic homogenization. \\nThe environmental revolution resulted, in large part, from a values meltdown in \\nthe main capitalist nations. Indeed, as Charles Hampden-Turner and Fons \\nTrompenaars explain in The Seven Cultures of Capitalism,\\n3 one result of the \\nsustainability revolutions outlined in earlier chapters might simply be to create one \\nmore culture of capitalism. Given that the triple bottom line approach can involve \\ntransitional costs to business, this outcome would be problematic. The pace of change would be severely slowed by the need to compete with others — from \\npragmatic entrepreneurs through to outright black marketeers — with shorter term \\nconcerns and fewer (or different) principles. Clearly, a far more desirable outcome would be for all cultures of capitalism to progressively internalize sustainability \\nthinking. \\nFor this to happen, we will need “sustainable corporations.” As I finished off this \\nbook, The Stakeholder Corporation by David Wheeler and Maria Sillanpää \\nappeared:\\n4 it is highly recommended.

But we also need new forms of international governance if such \\ncorporations are to appear, evolve, and flourish. \\nSustainable corporations and sustainable markets will rarely evolve of their own \\naccord. Indeed, one of the most interesting trends in the closing few years of the 20th century was the evolution of a much stronger appreciation of the central roles \\nplayed by governments, governance systems, and regulation in the civilization of \\ncapitalism. As Robert Kuttner puts it in Everything for Sale , a book bearing the \\nrevealing sub-title “The virtues and limits of markets,”\\n5 much post-1945 wealth \\ncreation flowed not from raw capitalism of the variety now being commended to \\nemergent nations around the world, but from the “mixed economy.” The idea underpinning this approach was that: \\n \\n“Market forces could do many things well — but not everything. Government \\nintervened to promote development, to temper the market’s distributive \\nextremes, to counteract its unfortunate tendency to boom-and-bust, to remedy \\nits myopic failure to invest too little in public goods, and to invest too much in processes that harmed the human and natural environment.” \\n \\nNo one disputes that market economies tend to out-perform their command-and-\\ncontrol competitors, but that does not mean that we should abandon everything that \\nsmacks of a command-and-control approach. Regulation is essential to the effective \\nand efficient working of markets, particularly in pursuit of emerging triple bottom line objectives. But, increasingly, we must learn to develop regulatory frameworks \\nwhich operate, as far as possible, through market processes and are intrinsically \\nprocompetition. \\nIn a mixed economy, as Kuttner argues: \\n \\n“the state intervenes to protect citizens from a variety of assaults that laissez-\\nfaire forces would otherwise produce. These include the spewing of pollutants \\ninto the air and water, the manufacture of dangerous products, the coercive \\npower of private business to condition employment on unsafe working conditions, and other ‘contracts of desperation’ that do not reflect truly \\nvoluntary transactions.” \\n \\nSupporters of unbridled capitalism may argue that it is up to investors, workers, and \\nconsumers to work out whether particular market offerings are safe, efficacious, and, \\nultimately, sustainable. But, as Kuttner concludes: ', metadata={'source': 'data_input/(The Conscientious Commerce Series) John Elkington - Cannibals With Forks_ The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business-New Society Publishers (1998).pdf', 'page': 401}),\n",

The individual citizen doesn’t have the basis to insist that the local public utility burn cleaner fuel or develop \\nlower-polluting technology — except via government regulation.” \\n \\nAfter two decades of celebrating markets and denigrating governments, we are \\nprobably on the threshold of a new era in which the triple bottom line agenda helps \\nto give governments and regulation new forms of legitimacy. Both will play central roles in developing the market instruments and technologies necessary for the \\nsustainability transition. But to make all this happen, we must increasingly learn \\nhow to mobilize the potential winners. For, as Machiavelli argued some 500 years ago: \\n \\n“There is nothing more difficult to plan, more doubtful of su ccess, nor more \\ndangerous to manage than the creation of a new system. For the initiator has \\nthe enmity of all who would profit from the preservation of the old \\ninstitutions, and merely lukewarm defenders in those who should gain by the new ones.” \\n \\nThere is still a tremendous amount of work to be done on waking up those \\nresponsible for running the interlinking worlds of politics, economics, and business. \\nOne way to attract the attention of boards, we have found, is to develop the right \\nscanning systems and metrics. For example, as explained in Chapter 13, we helped Business in the Environment (BiE) to develop its Index of Corporate Environmental \\nEngagement, based on ten environmental benchmarks.\\n6 It was clear that boiling all \\nof this complexity down into a single barometer-like set of readings had helped. “The Index was snappy enough to seize attention and appeal to boards’ competitive \\ninstincts,” said Paul Pritchard, environmental adviser at Royal Sun Alliance, one of \\nthree insurance groups ranked in the bottom quintile.\\n7 \\nEventually, similar surveys will be done on the sustainability of major companies \\nand key sectors of the economy.

As W. Chan Kim and Renée \\nMauborgne put it recently in the Harvard Business Review, “don’t focus on beating \\ncompetitors.”8 Focus, instead, on breaking out of the trap of today’s diminishing \\nreturn markets and aim to break into the increasing return markets of the future. \\nThe law of diminishing returns, the “hockey stick effect” discussed in Chapter \\n12, is well understood by economists. But we are now also seeing the so-called law \\nof “increasing returns” being developed and promoted by economists such as W. \\nBrian Arthur (based at Stanford and the Santa Fe Institute), Paul Krugman (Stanford), and Paul Romer (University of California at Berkeley). Described by \\nArthur as the tendency for something that gets ahead to get further ahead, this new \\nlaw has dramatic implications for corporations considering developing new sustainability-related products and services. “The more people use your product,” as \\nArthur puts it, “the more advantage you have — or, to put it another way, the bigger \\nyour installed base, the better off you are.”\\n9 \\nOf course, this law could also help fuel the growth of an industry that, ultimately, \\nwas unsustainable in some way, at least for a while.

Happily, there is a burgeoning literature produced by those at the cutting edge of a completely new paradigm now emerging. \\nOne of the most stimulating books I have read on this whole area is Kevin \\nKelly’s Out of Control.\\n10 In predicting a period of evolution when our machines, \\ncompanies, and economies become much more akin to biological and ecological \\nsystems, he notes that: \\n \\n“Anything which alters its environment to increase production of itself is \\nplaying the game of increasing returns. And all large, sustaining systems play \\nthe game. The law operates in economics, biology, computer science, and human psychology. Life on Earth alters Earth to beget more life.

In the process, too, \\nKelly encourages us to learn to honor our errors. “Even the most brilliant act of \\nhuman genius,” he notes, “in the final analysis, is an act of trial and error.” \\nThe history of social and economic development has been one of risk. What \\ndistinguishes the modern era is that we are getting much better at analyzing and managing many risks, but our scientific and technological inventiveness means that \\nnew risks are continuously being generated. In his book, Against the Gods, Peter \\nBernstein shows how a small group of thinkers “put the future at the service of the present,” by “showing the world how to understand risk, measure it, and weight its \\nconsequences.”\\n11 In the process, he argues, they converted risk-taking into “one of \\nthe prime catalysts that drives modern Western society.” \\nBy contrast, many of the campaigning groups that have grown up to promote \\ndifferent triple bottom line issues are by their very nature risk-averse. Typically, they \\nhave been happier telling others what not to do than advising on, and taking responsibility for, possible solutions. The watchdog role will remain critically \\nimportant right across the sustainability agenda, but this must also be matched with a \\nmore constructive approach to engagement with those in business who have, or who can help develop, the tools and other resources needed for the sustainability \\ntransition. To play this role well, they must develop a different view of risk and of \\nfailure. \\nAs Kelly concludes, “Evolution can be thought of as systematic error \\nmanagement.” The path to relative economic, social and ecological sustainability is \\nguaranteed to be littered with failures of every nature and scale. If we recognize them and learn from them, the transition will proceed faster and in more resource-\\nefficient ways. If, on the other hand, we prefer the short-term comfort of burying our \\nfailures, or of blaming scapegoats, the transition will be significantly slowed, or could even be derailed completely. \\nMeanwhile, for those who fear they may have missed the glory days of \\nenvironmentalism, never fear. Through waves and downwaves alike, the process of greening our minds and industries may have been under way for nearly forty years, \\nbut the process of putting the world economy on to a more sustainable footing has \\nonly just begun.

Instead, we need to capture, and, \\nincreasingly, to manage, the hugely powerful underlying dynamics. “In two years,” I predicted, “you will be using the phrase ‘triple bottom line’ without thinking about \\nit.” Yet, even as I said it, I knew that if we succeed in making this happen, \\neverything will have changed. \\nBusiness in the 21st century, in the new millennium, will, in a very real sense, be \\noperating in a new world.
